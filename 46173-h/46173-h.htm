<h2 class="p2">THE PROLOGUE.</h2>

<p class="pi p1"><i>On Deck</i>.&mdash;<i>Curry and Culture</i>.&mdash;<i>Alternative Distractions</i>.&mdash;<i>A
Period of Probation</i>.&mdash;<i>The Oath and the
Talisman</i>.&mdash;<i>Wavering</i>.&mdash;<i>A Chronological Error</i>.&mdash;<i>The
Time Bargain</i>.&mdash;<i>Tourmalin Opens an
Account.</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">Mr. Peter Tourmalin was sitting,
or rather lying, in a steamer-chair
on the first-class saloon-deck of the
P. and O. steamer <i>Boomerang</i>, which had not been
many days as yet on the voyage home from
Sydney. He had been trying to read; but it
was a hot morning, and the curry, of which
he had partaken freely at breakfast, had made
him feel a little heavy and disinclined for mental
exertion just then, particularly as Buckle's <i>History
of Civilisation</i>, the first volume of which he had
brought up from the ship's library, is not exactly
light literature at any time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>He wanted distraction of some sort, but he could
not summon up sufficient energy to rise and pace
the deck, as his only acquaintance on board, a Mr.
Perkins, was doing with a breezy vigour which
Tourmalin found himself feebly resenting.</p>

<p>Another alternative was open to him, it is true:
not far away were other deck-chairs, in which
some of the lady passengers were reading, writing,
and chatting more or less languidly. There were
not very many on board&mdash;for it was autumn, a
time at which homeward-bound vessels are not apt
to be crowded;&mdash;but even in that small group there
were one or two with whom it might have seemed
possible to pass a little time in a pleasant and
profitable manner. For instance, there was that
tall, graceful girl in the navy-blue skirt, and the
striped cotton blouse confined at her slender waist
by a leathern belt. (Tourmalin, it should be mentioned,
was in the habit of noticing the details of
feminine costume.) She had regular features, grey
eyes which lighted up whenever she spoke, and
an expression of singular nobility and sweetness;
her fair hair was fastened up in loose gleaming
masses under her highly becoming straw hat.</p>

<p>Peter watched her surreptitiously, from time to
time, from behind the third page of Buckle. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
was attempting to read a novel; but her attention,
like his own, wandered occasionally, and he even
fancied that he surprised her now and then in the
act of glancing at himself with a certain interest.</p>

<p>Near her was another girl, not quite so tall, and
darker, but scarcely less pleasing in appearance.
She wore a cool-looking pink frock, and her
luxuriant bronze tresses were set off by a simple
white-flannel cap. She held some embroidery in
her listless fingers, but was principally occupied in
gazing out to sea with a wistful and almost melancholy
expression. Her eyes were soft and brown,
and her features piquantly irregular; giving Peter,
who considered himself no mean judge of female
character, the impression of a highly emotional
and enthusiastic temperament. He thought he
saw signs that she also honoured him by her
notice.</p>

<p>Peter was a flat-headed little man, with weak
eyes and flaxen hair; but even flat-headed little
men may indulge these fancies at times, without
grossly deceiving themselves. He knew, as one
does learn such things on board ship, that the
name of the first young lady was Tyrrell, and that
she was the daughter of a judge who had been
spending the Long Vacation in a voyage to recruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
his health. Of the other, he knew no more than
that she was a Miss Davenport.</p>

<p>At present, however, he had no personal acquaintance
with either of them, and, in fact, as
has already been said, knew nobody on board to
speak to, except the energetic Mr. Perkins, a
cheery man with a large fund of general information,
who was going home on some business connected
with a banking house in Melbourne.</p>

<p>And yet it is not difficult to make acquaintances
on board ship, if a man cares to do so; accident
or design will provide opportunities in plenty, and
two or three days at sea are equivalent to at least
as many weeks on shore. And Peter being quite
aware of these facts, and by no means indifferent
to the society of the other sex, which, indeed, he
considered more interesting than that of his own,
it would seem that he must have had some strong
reason for having kept studiously apart from the
social life on board the <i>Boomerang</i>.</p>

<p>He had a reason, and it was this: he was an engaged
man, and on his probation. A bachelor, still
under thirty, of desultory habits which unfitted
him to shine in any profession, he had a competency&mdash;that
refuge of the incompetent&mdash;which
made him independent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Some months previously he had had the good
fortune to meet with a lady somewhat his junior
in years, but endowed with charms of mind and
character which excited his admiration and reverence.
He recognised that she supplied the qualities
in which he felt himself deficient; he was
weary of the rather purposeless life he had led. He
wanted a wife who would regulate and organise
his existence; and Miss Sophia Pinceney, with
her decision and her thoroughness, was eminently
the person to do it. So it was not long before he
took courage and proposed to her.</p>

<p>Miss Pinceney, though she had been highly
educated, and possessed a considerable fortune of
her own, was by no means inclined to look unfavourably
upon such a suitor. He might not be
quite her intellectual equal, but he was anxious to
improve his mind. He was amiable and amenable,
and altogether likely, under careful guidance, to
prove an excellent husband.</p>

<p>But she was prudent, and reason told her that
the suddenness of Peter's passion was no guarantee
of its enduring qualities. She had heard and seen
too much of a rather catholic susceptibility in his
nature, to feel it safe to incur so grave a risk as
marriage until she had certain proof that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
attachment to her was robust enough to bear the
severest test; and to that test she was determined
to submit him.</p>

<p>She consented to an engagement on one condition,
that he was to take a long voyage. If he
returned in the same mind, she would be sufficiently
sure of his constancy to marry him as soon
as he wished: if he did not, her misgivings would
be amply justified. There was very little sentiment
about Sophia; she took a practical and
philosophical view of the marriage union, as became
a disciple of Ibsen.</p>

<p>"I like you, Peter," she told him frankly; "you
have many qualities that endear you to me, but I
don't feel that I can depend upon you at present.
And from what I know of you, I fear it is only too
probable that absence and the attractive society
of a passenger-ship may lead you to discover that
you have mistaken the depth of the feeling you
entertain for me."</p>

<p>"But, look here, Sophia," he had expostulated;
"if you're afraid of that, why do you make me
go?"</p>

<p>"Because," she had replied, with her admirable
common-sense, "because, if my fears should
prove to be unhappily only too well-founded, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
shall, at least, have made the discovery before it
is too late."</p>

<p>And, in spite of all his protests, Peter had to go.
Sophia sought to reconcile him to this necessity
by pointing out the advantages of travel, the
enlarging effect it would have upon his mind, and
the opportunities a long sea-voyage afforded for
regular and uninterrupted study on the lines she
had already mapped out for him; but, despite
these consolations, he went away in low spirits.
When the moment came for parting, even the
strong-minded Sophia was seized with a kind of
compunction.</p>

<p>"Something tells me, Peter," she said, "that
the ordeal will prove too much for you: in spite
of your good resolutions, you will sooner or later
be drawn into some flirtation which will make you
forget me. I know you so well, Peter!"</p>

<p>"I wish you could show a little more confidence
in me," he had answered, in a wounded tone.
"Since I met you, Sophia, I have ceased to be
the butterfly I was. But as you seem to doubt
me, it may relieve your mind if I promise faithfully
that, while I am away from you, I will never,
under any inducement, allow myself to overstep
the limits of the most ordinary civility towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
any woman with whom I may be brought in contact.
I swear it, Sophia! Are you satisfied
now?"</p>

<p>Perhaps he had a secret prevision that a time
might come when this oath would prove a salutary
restraint upon his straying fancy, and it certainly
had an immediate and most reassuring effect
upon Sophia.</p>

<p>Tourmalin had gone out to Australia, had seen
something of the country during his stay in the
colony, and was now, as we have seen, on his
return; and during the whole time his oath, to
his great credit, had been literally and faithfully
kept.</p>

<p>During the voyage out, he had been too persistently
unwell to be inclined to dally with sentiment;
but in his subsequent wanderings, he had
avoided, or rather escaped, all intercourse with
any Colonial ladies who might by any possibility
affect his allegiance to Sophia, whose image consequently
still held undisputed possession of his
heart.</p>

<p>In case he should feel himself wavering at any
time, he had been careful to provide himself with
a talisman in the shape of a photograph, the mere
sight of which would be instantly effectual. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
somehow, since he had been on board the <i>Boomerang</i>,
the occasions on which he had been driven to refer
to this photograph had been growing more and
more frequent; while, at the same time, he had a
tormenting consciousness that it took an increasingly
longer time to work.</p>

<p>He brought it out now, and studied it attentively.
It was the likeness of a girl without any great
pretensions to beauty, with dark hair rolled neatly
back from a massive brow that shone with intellectuality;
penetrating eyes, whose keenness was
generally tempered by folding-glasses; a large, firm
mouth, and a square chin: altogether, the face of
a young woman who would stand no trifling.</p>

<p>He put it back respectfully in his pocket; but
the impulse to go across and drop, in an accidental
fashion, into a vacant seat near one of those two
girls was still unconquered. He was feeling so
dull; he had got such a very little way into the
<i>History of Civilisation</i>, a work which he was reading
rather for Sophia's satisfaction than his own, and
there was such a lot more of it! Might he not
allow himself a brief holiday, and beguile the long
weary morning with a little cheerful conversation?
It was most unlikely, strict etiquette being by
general consent suspended on board ship, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
either young lady would resent a hazarded remark&mdash;at
all events, he could but try.</p>

<p>But then his oath&mdash;his rash and voluntary oath
to Sophia&mdash;what of that? He had not, it was
true, debarred himself from ordinary civility; but
could he be sure of keeping always within those
bounds if the acquaintanceship was once established?
He had reasons for doubting this very
seriously. And, besides, had not Sophia more
than hinted in her last letter that, as a reward for
his fidelity, she might join the ship at Gibraltar
with her mother, and so put an earlier end to his
term of probation? He could not be too careful.
After holding out so long, it would be madness to
relax his precautions now. No, he would resist
these Sirens, like a modern Ulysses; though, in the
latter's case, the Sirens were not actually on board,
and, even then, the hero had to be lashed to the
mast. But Tourmalin felt confident, notwithstanding,
that he would prove at least as obdurate
as the wily Greek.</p>

<p>He was not a strong-minded man; but he had
one quality which is almost as valuable a safeguard
against temptation as strength of mind&mdash;namely,
timidity.</p>

<p>His love for his betrothed was chastened by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
considerable dash of awe, and he was resolved not
to compromise himself in her eyes just for the sake
of a little temporary distraction.</p>

<p>At this point of his deliberations he looked at
his watch: it was close upon twelve; only one hour
to be got through before tiffin. Why, an hour was
nothing; he could surely contrive to kill it over
Buckle! A little courage, a little concentration,
and he would certainly attain to an interest in
"the laws which govern human actions."</p>

<p>The ship's bells were just striking; he counted
the strokes: one, two, three, four, five&mdash;and no
more! There must be some mistake; it could not
possibly be only half-past ten. Why, it was hours
since breakfast!</p>

<p>"Looking at your watch, eh?" said his friend
Perkins, as he reached Peter's chair for about
the hundredth time. "Ah! you're fast, I see.
Haven't altered your watch yet? They've put
the ship's clock back again this morning; nearly
half-an-hour it was this time&mdash;it was rather less
yesterday and the day before: we shall go on
gaining so much extra time a day, I suppose, till
we get to Gib."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me that!" exclaimed
Peter, with a half-suppressed groan. If the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
had seemed tedious and interminable enough before,
how much more so was it now! How infinitely
greater would the effort be to fix his thoughts
resolutely on Buckle, and ignore the very existence
of his distracting neighbours, now that it was to
be daily prolonged in this exasperating manner!</p>

<p>"You don't seem to appreciate the arrangement?"
remarked the Manager, as he allowed himself
to drop cautiously&mdash;for he was a bulky man&mdash;into
a hammock-chair beside Tourmalin.</p>

<p>"Appreciate it!" said Peter, with strong disgust.
"Aren't there enough half-hours, and confoundedly
long ones, too, in the day as it is, without having
extra ones forced on you like this? And giving it
to us in the daytime, too! They might at least
put the clock back at night, when it wouldn't so
much matter. I do think it's very bad management,
I must say!"</p>

<p>His companion began a long explanation about
the meridian, and sun's time, and ship's time, and
Greenwich time, to which Peter gave but a very
intermittent attention, so stupefied did he feel at
this unwelcome discovery.</p>

<p>"It's a curious thing to think of," the other was
saying thoughtfully, "that a man, by simply
making a voyage like this, should make a clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
gain of several hours which he would never have
had at all if he had stayed at home!"</p>

<p>"I would much rather be without them" said
Peter. "I find it quite difficult enough to spend
the time as it is; and how on earth I can spend
any more, I don't know!"</p>

<p>"Why spend it, then?" asked his friend quietly.</p>

<p>"What else am I to do with it?"</p>

<p>"What else? See here, my friend; when you
have an amount of spare cash that you've no
immediate use for, you don't let it lie idle at home,
do you? You pay it in to your credit at a bank,
and let it remain on deposit till you <i>do</i> want it&mdash;eh?
Well, then, why not treat your spare time as you
would your spare cash. Do you see what I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Not altogether," confessed Peter, considerably
puzzled.</p>

<p>"It's simple enough nowadays. For instance,
the establishment I have the honour to be connected
with&mdash;the Anglo-Australian Joint Stock
Time Bank Limited&mdash;confines itself, as you are
doubtless aware, almost entirely to that class of
business."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Peter, no more enlightened than
before, "does it indeed? Would you mind explaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
what particular class of business it carries
on? I don't quite understand."</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, sir!" said the Manager, rather
irritably, "you must be uncommonly ignorant of
financial matters not to have heard of this before!
However, I will try to make it clear to you. I
daresay you have heard that 'Time is Money'?
Very well, all our operations are conducted on that
principle. We are prepared to make advances, on
good security of course, of time to almost any
amount; and we are simply overwhelmed with
applications for loans. Business men, as you may
know, are perpetually pressed for time, and will
consent to almost anything to obtain it. Our
transactions in time, sir, are immense. Why,
the amount of Time passing through our books
annually during the last ten years, averages&mdash;ah!
about sixty centuries! That's pretty well, I
think, sir?"</p>

<p>He was so perfectly business-like and serious
that Peter almost forgot to see anything preposterous
in what he said.</p>

<p>"It sounds magnificent," he said politely; "only,
you see, I don't want to borrow any time myself.
I've too much on my hands already."</p>

<p>"Just so," said the Manager; "but if you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
kindly hear me out, I am coming to that. Lending
time is only one side of our business; we are also
ready to accept the charge of any spare time that
customers may be willing to deposit with us, and,
with our experience and facilities, I need hardly
say that we are able to employ it to the best advantage.
Now, say, for example, that you wish to
open an account with us. Well, we'll take these
spare half-hours of yours that are only an encumbrance
to you at present, and if you choose to
allow them to remain on deposit, they will carry
interest at five per cent. per month; that is, five
minutes on every hour and three-quarters, roughly,
for each month, until you withdraw them. In that
way alone, by merely leaving your time with us
for six months you will gain&mdash;now, let me see&mdash;over
three additional hours in compound interest
on your original capital of ten hours or so. And
no previous notice required before withdrawal!
Let me tell you, sir, you will not find many banks
do business on such terms as that!"</p>

<p>"No," said Peter, who could not follow all this
arithmetic, "so I should imagine. Only, I don't
quite see, if you will pardon my saying so, what
particular advantage I should gain if I did open
an account of this sort."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't? You surprise me, you really do.
Here are you, with these additional hours lying
idle on your hands: you didn't expect 'em, and
don't want 'em. But how do you know that you
<i>mayn't</i> be glad of 'em at some time or other?
Just think how grateful you might be hereafter, if
you could get back a single one of these half-hours
which you find so tedious now. Half-an-hour on
board a fine ship like this, splendid weather,
bracing sea-air, perfect rest, pleasant company, and
so on&mdash;why, you'd be willing to pay any money
for it! Well, bank your extra time; and you can
draw every individual hour in quarters, halves,
or wholes, when you please and <i>as</i> you please.
<i>That's</i> the advantage of it, sir!"</p>

<p>"I think I see," said Peter: "only, how
am I to make the deposit in the first instance?"</p>

<p>"That's easily arranged. The captain can't
compel you to accept the time now by merely
putting back the hands of the clock, can he? So,
all <i>you</i> have to do is to abstain from altering your
watch so long as you are on board, and to fill up a
little form; after which I shall be happy to supply
you with a book of Time Cheques, which you can
fill up and present whenever you wish to spend a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
given number of minutes in the pleasantest possible
of ways."</p>

<p>"But where am I to present these cheques?"
inquired Peter.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the Manager, "there will be no
difficulty whatever about that. Any clock will
cash it for you&mdash;provided, of course, that it hasn't
stopped. You merely have to slip your cheque
underneath or behind it, and you will at once be
paid whatever amount of time the cheque is drawn
for. I can show you one of our forms if you
like?"</p>

<p>Here he brought out a bulky leather case, from
which he extracted a printed document, which he
handed to Peter.</p>

<p>Peter, however, being naturally cautious, felt a
hesitation which he scarcely liked to confess.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "the fact is, I should like
to know first ... I've never been engaged in
a&mdash;a transaction of this kind before; and, well&mdash;what
I mean is, do I incur any risk of&mdash;er&mdash;a
supernatural character?... It isn't like that
business of Faust's, eh, don't you know?"</p>

<p>The Manager took back the paper with an
abruptness which showed that his temper was
ruffled by this suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"My good sir!" he said, with a short offended
laugh, "don't, on any account, imagine that <i>I</i> care
two pins whether you become a depositor or not.
I daresay our house will continue to exist without
your account. As for liability, ours is a limited
concern; and, besides, a deposit would not constitute
you a shareholder. If you meant anything
more&mdash;well, I have still to learn that there's anything
diabolical about <i>me</i>, sir! I simply thought
I was doing you a good turn by making the suggestion;
and, besides, as a business man, I never
neglect any opportunity, however small. But it's
entirely as you please, I'm sure."</p>

<p>There was nothing in the least demoniacal, even
in his annoyance, and Peter was moved to contrition
and apology.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I really beg your pardon!" he said. "I do
hope I haven't offended you; and, if you will allow
me, I shall consider it a personal favour to be
allowed to open an account with your bank. It
would certainty be a great convenience to draw
some of this superfluous time at some future day,
instead of wasting it now. Where do I sign the
form?"</p>

<p>The Manager was appeased; and produced the
form once more, indicating the place for the signature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and even providing a stylograph-pen for the
purpose. It was still somewhat of a relief to
Peter's mind to find that the ink it contained was
of the ordinary black hue.</p>

<p>"And now, about cheques," said his friend, after
the signature had been obtained. "How many
do you think you would require? I should say
that, as the deposit is rather small, you will find
fifty more than sufficient? We shall debit you with
fifty seconds to cover the cheque-book. And we
always recommend 'bearer' cheques as, on the
whole, more convenient."</p>

<p>Peter said he would have fifty "bearer" cheques,
and was accordingly given an oblong grey-green
book, which, except that it was a trifle smaller,
was in nowise different, outwardly, from an
ordinary cheque-book. Still, his curiosity was not
completely satisfied.</p>

<p>"There is just one question more," he said.
"When I draw this time, where will it be
spent?"</p>

<p>"Why, naturally, on board this ship," explained
the Manager. "You see that the time you will
get must necessarily be the extra time to which
you are entitled by virtue of your passage, and
which you <i>would</i> have spent as it accrued if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
had not chosen to deposit it with us. By the way,
when you are filling up cheques, we much prefer
not to be called upon to honour drafts for less than
fifteen minutes; as much more as you like, but not
less. Well, then, we may consider that settled. I
am extremely glad to have had the opportunity of
obliging you; and I think I can promise that you
will have no reason to repent of having made such
a use of your time. I'll wish you good-bye for
the present, sir!"</p>

<p>The Manager resumed his hygienic tramp round
the deck, leaving Peter with the cheque-book in
his hand. He was no longer surprised: now that
he was more familiar with the idea, it seemed a
perfectly natural and matter-of-fact arrangement;
he only wondered that he had never thought of so
obvious a plan before. And it was an immense
relief to know that he had got rid of his extra
hours for the present, at all events, and that he
could now postpone them to a period at which
they would be a boon rather than a burden.</p>

<p>And very soon he put the cheque-book away,
and forgot all about it.</p>

<hr class="dec1" />

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><b>Tourmalin's First Cheque, and How he Took It.</b></p>

<p class="pi p1"><i>Fidelity Rewarded</i>.&mdash;<i>Love's Catechism</i>.&mdash;<i>Brain-fag</i>.&mdash;<i>A
Timely Recollection</i>.&mdash;<i>The Experiment, and
some Startling Results</i>.&mdash;<i>Question Time</i>.&mdash;"<i>Dear
Friends</i>."&mdash;<i>A Compromise</i>.</p>

<p class="pn p2">Peter Tourmalin's probation was at
an end, and, what was more, he had come
through the ordeal triumphantly. How he
managed this, he scarcely knew; no doubt he was
aided by the consciousness that the extra hours
which he felt himself most liable to mis-spend had
been placed beyond his disposal. At all events,
when he met Sophia again, he had been able to
convince her that her doubts of his constancy,
even under the most trying conditions, were
entirely undeserved. Now he was receiving his
recompense: his engagement to Sophia was no
longer conditional, but a recognised and irrevocable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
fact. It is superfluous to say that he was
happy. Sophia had set herself to repair the deficiencies
in his education and culture; she took
him to scientific lectures and classical concerts,
and made him read standard authors without skipping.
He felt himself daily acquiring balance and
seriousness, and an accurate habit of thought, and
all the other qualities which Sophia wished him to
cultivate.</p>

<p>Still, there were moments when he felt the need
of halting and recovering his wind, so to speak,
in the steep and toilsome climb to her superior
mental level&mdash;times when he felt that his overtaxed
brain absolutely required relaxation of
some sort.</p>

<p>He felt this particularly one dreary morning,
late in November, as he sat in his London chambers,
staring with lack-lustre eyes at the letter he
had that day received from his betrothed. For
although they met nearly every day, she never
allowed one to pass without a letter&mdash;no fond
and foolish effusion, be it understood, but a kind
of epistolary examination-paper, to test the progress
he was making. This one contained
some searching questions on Buckle's <i>History of
Civilisation</i>, which he was expected to answer by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
return of post. He was not supposed to look at
the book, though he had; and even then he
felt himself scarcely better fitted to floor the
tremendous posers devised by Sophia's unwearying
care.</p>

<p>The day before, he had had "search-questions"
in English poetry from Chaucer to Mr. Lewis
Morris, which had thinned and whitened his hair;
but this was, if possible, even worse.</p>

<p>He wished now that he had got up his Buckle
more thoroughly during his voyage on the
<i>Boomerang</i>&mdash;and, with the name, his arrangement
with the Manager suddenly rose to his recollection.
What had he done with that book of Time
Cheques? If he could only get away, if but for a
quarter of a hour&mdash;away from those sombre rooms,
with their outlook on dingy housetops and a
murky rhubarb-coloured sky,&mdash;if he could really
exchange all that for the sunniness and warmth
and delicious idleness which had once seemed so
tedious, what a rest it would be! And would he
not return after such an interlude with all his
faculties invigorated, and better able to cope with
the task he now found almost insuperable?</p>

<p>The first thing was to find the cheque-book,
which did not take him long; though when he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
found it, something made him pause before filling
up a cheque. What if he had been made a fool of&mdash;if
the Anglo-Australian Joint Stock Time Bank
Limited never existed, or had suspended payment?
But that was easily settled by presenting a cheque.
Why should he not, just by way of experiment?
His balance was intact as yet; he was never likely
to need a little ready time more than he did just
then. He would draw the minimum amount,
fifteen minutes, and see how the system worked.</p>

<p>So, although he had little real confidence that
anything would happen at all, he drew a cheque,
and slipped it behind the frivolous and rather incorrect
little ormolu clock upon his chimneypiece.</p>

<p>The result was instantaneous, and altogether
beyond his expectations! The four walls of his
room assumed the transparency of gauze for a
second, before fading entirely away; the olive
fog changed to translucent blue; there was a
briny breath in the air, and he himself was leaning
upon the rail at the forward end of the
hurricane-deck of the <i>Boomerang</i>, which was riding
with a slow and stately rise and fall over the
heaving swell.</p>

<p>That was surprising enough; but more surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
still was the discovery that he was
apparently engaged in close and confidential
conversation with a lovely person in whom he
distinctly recognised Miss Tyrrell.</p>

<p>"Yes, I forgive you, Mr. Tourmalin," she was
saying, with an evident effort to suppress a certain
agitation; "but indeed, <i>indeed</i>, you must never
speak to me like that again!"</p>

<p>Now, as Peter was certainly not conscious of
ever having spoken to her at all in his life, this
was naturally a startling and even embarrassing
beginning.</p>

<p>But he had presence of mind enough to take
in the position of affairs, and adapt himself to
them. This was one of the quarters of an hour
he <i>would</i> have had, and it was clear that in some
portion or other of his spare time he would have
made Miss Tyrrell's acquaintance in some way.
Of course, he ought to have been paid that particular
time first; but he could easily see from
her manner, and the almost tender friendliness
which shone in her moistened eyes, that at this
period they had advanced considerably beyond
mere acquaintanceship. There had been some
little mistake probably; the cheques had been
wrongly numbered perhaps, or else they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
honoured without regard to chronological sequence,
which was most confusing.</p>

<p>Still, he had nothing to do but conceal his
ignorance as well as he could, and pick up the
loose threads as he went along. He was able,
at all events, to assure her that he would not,
if he could help it, incur her displeasure by speaking
to her "like that" in future.</p>

<p>"Thanks," she said. "I know it was only a
temporary forgetfulness; and&mdash;and if what you
suspect should prove to be really true&mdash;why, then,
Mr. Tourmalin, then, of course, you may come
and tell me so."</p>

<p>"I will," he said; "I shall make a point of
it. Only," he thought to himself, "she will have
to tell me first <i>what</i> I'm to tell her."</p>

<p>"And in the meantime," she said, "let us go
on as before, as if you had never brought yourself
to confide your sad story to me."</p>

<p>So he had told a sad story, had he? he
thought, much bewildered; for, as he had no
story belonging to him of that character, he was
afraid he must have invented one, while, of course,
he could not ask for information.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with great presence of mind,
"forget my unhappy story&mdash;let it never be mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
between us again. We will go on as before&mdash;<i>exactly</i>
as before."</p>

<p>"It is our only course," she agreed. "And
now," she added, with a cheerfulness that struck
him as a little forced, "suppose we talk of something
else."</p>

<p>Peter considered this a good suggestion, provided
it was a subject he knew a little more
about; which, unhappily, it was not.</p>

<p>"You never answered my question," she reminded
him.</p>

<p>He would have liked, as Ministers say in the
House, "previous notice of that question;" but
he could hardly say so in so many words.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Forgive me if I say that it
is a&mdash;a painful subject to me."</p>

<p>"I understand that," she said, gently (it was
more than <i>he</i> did); "but tell me only this: was it
<i>that</i> that made you behave as you did? You are
sure you had no <i>other</i> reason?"</p>

<p>["If I say I had," thought Peter, "she will
ask me what it was."] "I will be as frank as
possible, Miss Tyrrell," he replied. "I had <i>no</i>
other reason. What other reason <i>could</i> I have
had?"</p>

<p>"I half fancied&mdash;but I ought to have seen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the first that, whatever it was, it was not that.
And now you have made everything quite clear."</p>

<p>"I am glad you find it so," said Peter, with a
touch of envy.</p>

<p>"But I might have gone on misunderstanding
and misjudging, putting you down as proud and
cold and unsociable, or prejudiced, but for the
accident which brought us together, in spite of
your determination that we should remain total
strangers!"</p>

<p>It was an <i>accident</i> which had made them acquainted,
then? He would draw the cheque
which contained that episode of his extra time
sooner or later; but it was distinctly inconvenient
not to have at least <i>some</i> idea of what had happened.</p>

<p>"A fortunate accident for me, at all events!" he
said, with a judicious recourse to compliment.</p>

<p>"It might have been a very unfortunate one for
poor papa," she said, "but for you. I do believe
he would have been quite inconsolable."</p>

<p>Peter felt an agreeable shock. Had he really
been fortunate enough to distinguish himself by
rescuing the Judge's fair daughter from some deadly
peril? It looked very like it. He had often
suspected himself of a latent heroism which had
never had an opportunity of being displayed. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
opportunity must have occurred, and he have
proved equal to the occasion, in one of those extra
hours!</p>

<p>"I can quite imagine that he would be inconsolable
indeed!" he said gallantly. "Fortunately,
I was privileged to prevent such a calamity."</p>

<p>"Tell me again exactly <i>how</i> you did it," she
said. "I never quite understood."</p>

<p>Peter again took refuge in a discreet vagueness.</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied, modestly, "there's not much
to tell. I saw the&mdash;er&mdash;danger, and knew there
wasn't a moment to lose; and then I sprang forward,
and&mdash;well, you know the rest as well as I
do!"</p>

<p>"You only just caught him as he was going up
the rigging, didn't you?" she asked.</p>

<p>So it was the Judge he had saved&mdash;not his
daughter! Peter felt a natural disappointment.
But he saw the state of the case now: a powerful
judicial intellect overstrained, melancholia, suicidal
impulses&mdash;it was all very sad; but, happily, he had
succeeded in saving this man to his country.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;ventured to detain him," he said, considerately,
"seeing that he was&mdash;er&mdash;rather excited."</p>

<p>"But weren't you afraid he would bite you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Peter, pained at this revelation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the Judge's condition, "that possibility did <i>not</i>
occur to me. In fact, I am sure that&mdash;er&mdash;though
the strongest intellects are occasionally subject to
attacks of this sort, he would never so far forget
himself as to&mdash;er&mdash;bite a complete stranger."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, "you don't know what a savage
old creature he can be sometimes. He never
ought to be let loose; I'm sure he's dangerous!"</p>

<p>"Oh! but think, Miss Tyrrell," remonstrated
Peter, unmistakably shocked at this unfilial attitude
towards a distinguished parent; "if he was&mdash;er&mdash;dangerous,
he would not be upon the Bench now,
surely!"</p>

<p>She glanced over her shoulder, with evident
apprehension.</p>

<p>"How you frightened me!" she said. "I thought
he was really there! But I hope they'll shut him
up in future, so that he won't be able to do any
more mischief. You didn't tell me how you got
hold of him. Was it by his chain, or his tail?"</p>

<p>Peter did not know; and, besides, it was as
difficult for him to picture himself in the act of
seizing a hypochondriacal judge by his watch-chain
or coat-tail, as it was for him to comprehend the
utter want of feeling that could prompt such a
question from the sufferer's own daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope," he said, with a gravity which he
intended as a rebuke&mdash;"I hope I treated him with
all the respect and consideration possible under
the&mdash;er&mdash;circumstances.... I am sorry that
that remark appears to amuse you!"</p>

<p>For Miss Tyrrell was actually laughing, with a
merriment in which there was nothing forced.</p>

<p>"How can I help it?" she said, as soon as she
could speak. "It is too funny to hear you talking
of being regretful and considerate to a horrid
monkey!"</p>

<p>"A <i>monkey!</i>" he repeated involuntarily.</p>

<p>So it was a monkey that was under restraint,
and not a Judge of Her Majesty's Supreme Court
of Judicature: a discovery which left him as much
in the dark as to what particular service he had
rendered as ever, and made him tremble to think
what he might have said. But apparently, by
singular good fortune, he had not committed himself
beyond recovery; for Miss Tyrrell only said:</p>

<p>"I thought you were speaking of the monkey,
the little wretch that came up behind papa and
snatched away all his notes&mdash;the notes he had
made for the great case he tried last term, and has
to deliver judgment upon when the Courts sit
again. Surely he told you how important they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
were, and how awkward it would have been if the
monkey had escaped with them, and torn them
into pieces or dropped them into the sea?&mdash;as he
probably would have done, but for you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, ah, yes!" said Peter, feeling slightly crestfallen,
for he had hoped he had performed a more
dashing deed than catching a loose monkey. "I
believe your father&mdash;Sir John?" he hazarded ...
"Sir William, of course, thank you ... did
mention the fact. But it really was such a trifling
thing to do."</p>

<p>"Papa didn't think so," she said. "He declares
he can never be grateful enough to you. And,
whatever it was," she added softly, and even shyly,
"I, at least, can never think lightly of a service
which has&mdash;has made us what we are to one
another."</p>

<p><i>What they were to one another!</i> And what was <i>that</i>?
A dreadful uncertainty seized upon Peter. Was
it possible that, in some way he did not understand,
he was engaged to this very charming girl,
who was almost a stranger to him? The mere
idea froze his blood; for if that was so, how
did it affect his position towards Sophia? At all
hazards, he must know the worst at once!</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, with trembling accents,&mdash;"I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
know you have told me already, but tell me once
more&mdash;precisely what we are to one another at
present. It would be so much more satisfactory
to my mind," he added, in a deprecatory tone, "to
have that clearly understood."</p>

<p>"I thought I had made it quite clear already,"
she said, with the least suspicion of coldness, "that
we can be nothing more to one another than
friends."</p>

<p>The relief was almost too much for him. What
a dear, good, sensible girl she was! How perfectly
she appreciated the facts!</p>

<p>"<i>Friends!</i>" he cried. "Is that <i>all</i>? Do you
really mean we are nothing more than friends?"</p>

<p>He caught her hand, in the fervour of his
gratitude, and she allowed it to remain in his
grasp; which, in the altered state of things, he
found rather pleasant than otherwise.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she murmured, "don't ask me for more
than I have said&mdash;more than I can ever say, perhaps!
Let us be content with remaining friends&mdash;dear
friends, if you like&mdash;but no more!"</p>

<p>"I will," said Peter promptly, "I will be content.
Dear friends, by all means; but no more!"</p>

<p>"No," she assented; "unless a time should
come when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, encouragingly, as she hesitated.
"You were about to say, a time when&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Her lips moved, a faint flush stole into her
cheeks; she was about to complete her sentence,
when her hand seemed to melt away in his own,
and he stood, grasping the empty air, by his own
mantelpiece. The upper deck, the heaving bows,
the blue seaboard, Miss Tyrrell herself, all had
vanished; and in their stead were the familiar
surroundings of his chamber, the grimy London
house fronts, and Sophia's list of questions lying
still unanswered upon his writing-table! His
fifteen minutes had come to an end; the cheque
was nowhere to be seen. The minute-hand of his
clock had not moved since he last saw it; but this
last circumstance, as he saw on reflection, was
only natural, for otherwise the Time Deposit would
have conferred no real advantage, as he would
never have regained the hours he had temporarily
foregone.</p>

<p>For some time Peter sat perfectly still, with his
head between his hands, occupied in a mental
review of this his initial experience of the cheque-book
system. It was as different as possible from
the spell of perfect rest he had anticipated; but
had it been unpleasant on that account? In spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of an element of mystification at starting, which
was inevitable, he was obliged to admit to himself
that he had enjoyed this little adventure more
than perhaps he should have done. With all his
attachment to Sophia, he could hardly be insensible
to the privilege of suddenly finding himself
the friend&mdash;and more than that, the dear friend&mdash;of
so delightful a girl as this Miss Tyrrell.</p>

<p>There was a strange charm, a peculiar and quite
platonic tenderness about an intimacy of this peculiar
and unprecedented nature, which increased
at every fresh recollection of it. It increased so
rapidly indeed, that almost unconsciously he drew
the cheque-book towards him, and began to fill up
another cheque with a view to an immediate
return to the <i>Boomerang</i>.</p>

<p>But when he had torn the cheque out, he hesitated.
It was all quite harmless: the most severe
moralist could not convict him of even the most
shadowy infidelity towards his <i>fiançée</i>, if he chose
to go back and follow up a purely retrospective
episode like this&mdash;an episode which interested and
fascinated him so strongly&mdash;only, what would
Sophia say to it? Instinctively, he felt that the
situation, innocent as it was, would fail to commend
itself to her. He had no intention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
informing her, it was true; but he knew that he
was a poor dissembler&mdash;he might easily betray
himself in some unguarded moment, and then&mdash;&mdash; No!
it was vexing, no doubt; but, upon
the whole, it was wiser and better to renounce
those additional hours on board the <i>Boomerang</i>
altogether&mdash;to allow this past, that never had,
but only might have been, to remain unsummoned
and unknown for ever. Otherwise, who
could tell that, by gradual assaults, even such an
affection as he had for Sophia might not be
eventually undermined?</p>

<p>But this fear, as he saw the next moment, was
almost too extravagant to be seriously taken into
account. He felt nothing, and never could feel
anything, but warm and sincere friendship for Miss
Tyrrell; and it was satisfactory to know that she
was in no danger of mistaking his sentiments.
Still, of course there was always a certain risk,
particularly when he was necessarily in ignorance
of all that had preceded and followed the only
colloquy they had had as yet. At last he decided
upon a compromise: he would not cash that second
cheque for the present, at all events; he would
reserve it for an emergency, and only use it if he
was absolutely driven to do so as a mental tonic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Perhaps Sophia would not compel him to such a
necessity again; he hoped&mdash;at least, he <i>thought</i>
she would not.</p>

<p>So he put the unpresented cheque in an inner
pocket, and set to work with desperate energy at
his examination-paper; although his recent change
must have proved less stimulating to his jaded
faculties than he had hoped, since Sophia, after
reading his answers, made the cutting remark that
she scarcely knew which he had more completely
failed to apprehend&mdash;the purport of his author,
or that of the very simple questions she had set
him.</p>

<p>Peter could not help thinking, rather ruefully,
that Miss Tyrrell would never have been capable
of such severity as that; but, then, Miss Tyrrell
was not his <i>fiançée</i>, only a very dear friend, whom
he would, most probably, never meet again.</p>

<p class="pn center mid"><b>The Second Cheque.</b></p>

<p class="pi p1"><i>Furnishing.</i>&mdash;<i>A Cosy Corner.</i>&mdash;<i>"Sitting Out."</i>&mdash;<i>Fresh
Discoveries.</i>&mdash;<i>Twice a Hero.</i>&mdash;<i>Bewilderment
and Bathos.</i></p>


<p class="pn p2">The knowledge that one has a remedy
within reach is often as effectual as the
remedy itself, if not more so; which may
account for the fact that, although a considerable
number of weeks had elapsed since Peter Tourmalin
had drawn his second cheque on the Anglo-Australian
Joint Stock Time Bank Limited, that
cheque still remained unpresented.</p>

<p>The day fixed for his wedding with Sophia was
drawing near; the flat in the Marylebone Road,
which was to be the scene of their joint felicity,
had to be furnished, and this occupied most of his
time. Sophia took the entire business upon herself,
for she had scientific theories on the subject
of decoration and colour harmonies which Peter
could only accept with admiring awe; but, nevertheless,
she required him to be constantly at hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
so that she could consult him after her own mind
had been irrevocably made up.</p>

<p>One February afternoon he was wandering
rather disconsolately about the labyrinthine passages
of one of the monster upholstery establishments
in the Tottenham Court Road, his chief
object being to evade the courtesies of the numerous
assistants as they anxiously inquired what they
might have the pleasure of showing him. He and
Sophia had been there since mid-day; and she had
sat in judgment upon carpets which were brought
out, plunging like unbroken colts, by panting foremen,
and unrolled before her in a blinding riot of
colour. Peter had only to express the mildest
commendation of any carpet to seal that carpet's
doom instantly; so that he soon abstained from
personal interference.</p>

<p>Now Sophia was in the ironmongery department,
choosing kitchen utensils, and his opinion
being naturally of no value on such matters, he
was free to roam wherever he pleased within the
limits of the building. He felt tired and rather
faint, for he had had no lunch; and presently he
came to a series of show-rooms fitted up as rooms
in various styles: there was one inviting-looking
interior, with an elaborate chimneypiece which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
had cosy cushioned nooks on either side of the
fireplace, and into one of these corners he sank
with heartfelt gratitude; for it was a comfortable
seat, and he had not sat down for hours. But
as his weariness wore away, he felt the want of
something to occupy his mind, and searched in his
pockets to see if he had any letters there&mdash;even
notes of congratulation upon his approaching
marriage would be better than nothing in his present
reduced condition. But he had left all his
correspondence at his chambers. The only document
he came upon was the identical time cheque
he had drawn long ago: it was creased and rumpled;
but none the less negotiable, if he could find
a clock. And on the built-up chimneypiece there
was a clock, a small <i>faience</i> affair surmounted by a
Japanese monster in peacock-blue. Moreover, by
some chance, this clock was actually going&mdash;he
could hear it ticking as he sat there. Should he
present his cheque or not? He was feeling a little
aggrieved at Sophia's treatment of him, she had
snubbed him so unmercifully over the carpets; it
was pleasant to think that, if he chose, he could
transport himself that very instant to the society
of a sweet and appreciative companion from whom
snubbing was the last thing to be apprehended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes; Sophia's treatment quite justified him in
making an exception to the rule he had laid
down for himself&mdash;he <i>would</i> present that cheque.
And he rose softly from his seat and pushed the
cheque under the little timepiece....</p>

<p>As before, his draft was honoured immediately:
he found himself on a steamer-chair in a sheltered
passage between two of the deck-cabins. It was
night, and he could not clearly distinguish any
objects around him for some little time, owing to the
darkness; but from a glimmer of white drapery
that was faintly visible close by, he easily inferred
that there was another chair adjoining his, which
could only be occupied by Miss Tyrrell. He could
just hear the ship's band playing a waltz at the
further end of the ship; it was one of the evenings
when there had been dancing, and he and Miss
Tyrrell were sitting out together.</p>

<p>All this he realised instantly, and not without a
thrill of interest and expectation, which, however,
the first words she uttered were sufficient to reduce
to the most prosaic perplexity.</p>

<p>"What have I said?" she was moaning, in a
voice hardly recognisable from emotion and the
fleecy wrap in which her face was muffled,&mdash;"oh!
what <i>have</i> I said?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter was naturally powerless to afford her any
information on this point, even if she really
required it; he made a rapid mental note to the
effect that their intimacy had evidently made great
progress since their last interview.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," he said, deciding that candour
was his only course, "I can't exactly tell you what
you did say; for, as a matter of fact, I didn't quite
catch it."</p>

<p>"Ah! you say that to spare me," she murmured:
"you <i>must</i> have heard; but, promise me
you will forget it?"</p>

<p>"Willingly," said Peter, with the greatest
readiness to oblige; "I will consider it forgotten."</p>

<p>"If I could but hope that!" she said. "And yet,"
she added, recklessly, "why should I care what I
say?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," agreed Tourmalin at random,
"why <i>should</i> you, you know?"</p>

<p>"You must have seen from the first that I was
very far from being happy?"</p>

<p>"I must confess," said Peter, with the air of a
man whom nothing escaped, "that I <i>did</i> observe
that."</p>

<p>"And you were right! Was it unnatural that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
should be nothing but grateful to the chance which
first brought us together?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Peter, delighted to feel himself
on solid ground again; "indeed, if I may speak
for myself, I have even greater reason to feel
grateful to that monkey."</p>

<p>"To <i>what</i> monkey?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why, naturally, my dear Miss Tyrrell, to the
animal which was the unconscious instrument in
making us acquainted. You surely cannot have
forgotten already that it <i>was</i> a monkey?"</p>

<p>She half rose with an impetuous movement, the
mantilla fell from her face, and, even in the faint
starlight, he could perceive that, beautiful as that
face undoubtedly was, it was as certainly not the
face of Miss Tyrrell!</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> seem to have forgotten a great deal," she
retorted, with a suppressed sob in her voice, "or
you would at least remember that my name is
Davenport. Why you should choose to call me
Miss Tyrrell, whom I don't even know by sight, I
can't conceive!"</p>

<p>Here was a discovery, and a startling one! It
appeared that he had not merely one, but two dear
friends on board this P. and O. steamer; and the
second seemed, if possible, even dearer than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
first! He must have made the very most of those
extra hours!</p>

<p>There was one comfort, however, Miss Davenport
did not, contrary to his impression, know
Miss Tyrrell; so that they need not necessarily
clash&mdash;still, it was undeniably awkward. He had
to get out of his mistake as well as he could,
which was but lamely.</p>

<p>"Why, of <i>course</i>," he protested, "I know <i>you</i> are
Miss Davenport. Most stupid of me to address
you as Miss Tyrrell! The&mdash;the only explanation
I can offer is, that before I had the pleasure of
speaking to you, I was under the impression that
your proper name was <i>Tyrrell</i>, and so it slipped
out again just then from habit."</p>

<p>This&mdash;though the literal, if not the moral, truth&mdash;did
not seem to satisfy her entirely.</p>

<p>"That may be so," she said, curtly; "still, it
does not explain why you should address me as
<i>Miss</i> Anybody, after asking and receiving permission,
only last night, to call me by my Christian
name!"</p>

<p>Obviously, their relations were even closer
than he had imagined. He had no idea they had
got as far as Christian names already, any more
than he had of what hers might happen to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a painful want of method in the
manner this Time Bank conducted its business,
as he could not help remarking to himself; however,
Peter, perhaps from the very timidity in his
character, developed unexpected adroitness in a
situation of some difficulty.</p>

<p>"So you did!" he said. "You allowed me to
call you by your&mdash;er&mdash;Christian name; but I value
such a privilege too highly to use it&mdash;er&mdash;indiscriminately."</p>

<p>"You are very strange to-night!" she said, with
a plaintive and almost childish quiver of the lip.
"First you call me 'Miss Tyrrell' and then 'Miss
Davenport,' and then you will have it that we
were introduced by a monkey! As if I should
ever allow a monkey to introduce <i>anybody</i> to
me! Is saving a girl's life such an ordinary
event with you, that you forget all about such
a trifle?"</p>

<p>This last sentence compensated Peter for all
that had gone before. Here was a person whose
life he really <i>had</i> saved; and his heart warmed to
her from that moment. Rescuing a girl from
imminent bodily peril was a more heroic achievement
than capturing the most mischievous of
monkeys; and, besides, he felt it was far more in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his style. So it was in his best manner he replied
to her question:</p>

<p>"It would be strange, indeed," he said, reproachfully,
"if I could ever forget that I was the
humble means of preserving you from&mdash;from a
watery grave"&mdash;(he risked the epithet, concluding
that on a voyage it could hardly be any other
description of grave; and she did not challenge it,
so he continued)&mdash;"a watery grave; but I <i>had</i>
hoped you would appreciate the motive which
restrained me from&mdash;er&mdash;seeming to dwell upon
such a circumstance."</p>

<p>This appeal, unprincipled as it was, subdued
her instantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, forgive me!" she said, putting out her
hand with the prettiest penitence. "I might have
known you better than that. I didn't mean it.
Please say you forgive me, and&mdash;and call me
Maud again!"</p>

<p>Relief at being supplied with a missing clue
made Peter reckless; indeed, it is to be feared
that demoralisation had already set in; he took
the hand she gave him, and it did not occur to
him to let it go immediately.</p>

<p>"Maud, then," he said obediently; "I forgive
you, Maud."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a prettier name to pronounce than
Sophia.</p>

<p>"How curious it is," she was saying, dreamily,
as she nestled comfortably in her chair beside him,
"that, up to the very moment when you rushed
forward that day, I scarcely gave your existence
a thought! And now&mdash;how little we ever know
what is going to happen to us, do we?"</p>

<p>["Or what <i>has</i> happened, for that matter!" he
thought.] This time he would not commit himself
to details until he could learn more about the
precise nature of his dauntless act, which he at
once proceeded to do.</p>

<p>"I should very much like to know," he suggested,
"what your sensations were at that critical
moment."</p>

<p>"My sensations? I hardly know," she said.
"I remember leaning over the&mdash;bulwarks, is it?"
(Peter said it <i>was</i> bulwarks)&mdash;"the bulwarks,
watching a sailor in a little balcony below, who
was doing something with a long line&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heaving the lead," said Peter; "so he was&mdash;go
on!"</p>

<p>He was intensely excited; it was all plain
enough: she had lost her balance and fallen
overboard; he had plunged in, and gallantly kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
her above water till help arrived. He had always
known he was capable of this sort of thing; now
he had proved it!</p>

<p>"&mdash;When all at once," she continued, "I felt
myself roughly dragged back by somebody&mdash;that
was you! I was rather angry for the moment, for
it <i>did</i> seem quite a liberty for a total stranger to
take,&mdash;when, that very instant, I saw the line
with a great heavy lump of lead at the end of it
whirled round exactly where my head had been,
and then I knew that I owed my life to your
presence of mind!"</p>

<p>Peter was more than disappointed&mdash;he was
positively disgusted at this exceedingly tame
conclusion; it <i>did</i> seem hard that, even under
conditions when any act of daring might have
been possible to him, he could do nothing more
brilliant than this. It was really worse than the
monkey business!</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you make too much of the very little
I did," he said.</p>

<p>"Do I? Perhaps that is because if you had not
done it, we should never have come to know one
another as we do!" (So far, it was a very one-sided
sort of knowledge, Peter thought.) "And yet," she
added, with a long-drawn sigh, "I sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
think that we should both be happier if we never
<i>had</i> known one another; if you had stood aside,
and the lead had struck me, and I had died!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Peter, unfeignedly alarmed at
this morbid reflection, "you mustn't take such a
gloomy view of it as all that, you know!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" she said, in a sombre tone. "It <i>is</i>
gloomy&mdash;<i>how</i> gloomy I know better than you!"
("She might well do that," thought Tourmalin.)
"Why did I not see that I was slowly, imperceptibly
drifting&mdash;drifting?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Peter, with a levity he was far
from feeling, "if the drifting was imperceptible,
you naturally <i>wouldn't</i> see it, you know!"</p>

<p>"You might have spared a joke at such a time
as this!" she cried, indignantly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wasn't aware there was a close time for
jokes," he said, humbly; "not that it was much of
a joke!"</p>

<p>"Indeed it was not," she replied. "But oh,
Peter, <i>how</i> we have both drifted!"</p>

<p>"Have we?" he exclaimed, blankly. "I&mdash;I
mean&mdash;<i>haven't</i> we?"</p>

<p>"I was so blind&mdash;so wilfully, foolishly blind!
I told myself we were friends!"</p>

<p>"Surely we are?" he said, retaking possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of her hand; he had entirely forgotten Sophia in
the ironmongery department, at Tottenham Court
Road. "I&mdash;I understood we were on that
footing?"</p>

<p>"No," she said; "let us have no subterfuges
any more&mdash;we must look facts in the face. After
what we have both said to-night, we can no longer
deceive ourselves by words.... Peter," she
broke off suddenly, "I am going to ask you a
question, and on your answer my fate&mdash;and yours
too, perhaps&mdash;will depend! Tell me truthfully...."
Her voice failed her for the moment, as
she bent over towards him, and clutched his arm
tightly in her excitement; her eyes shone with a
wild, intense eagerness for his reply.... "Would
you&mdash;&mdash;" she repeated....</p>

<p>"Would you have the bottle-jack all brass, or
japanned? The brass ones are a shilling more."</p>

<p>Peter gave a violent start, for the voice in which
this most incongruous and irrelevant question was
put was that of Sophia!</p>

<p>Miss Davenport with her hysterical appeal, the
steamer-chairs, and the starlight, all had fled, and
he stood, supporting himself limply by the arm of
the chimney-nook in the upholsterer's showroom,
staring at Sophia, who stood there, sedate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
practical, inviting his attention to a couple of
bottle-jacks which an assistant was displaying
with an obsequious smile: the transition was
rather an abrupt one.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think the brass one is very nice," he
stammered, feebly enough.</p>

<p>"Then that settles it," remarked Sophia; "we'll
take the <i>japanned</i> one, please," she said to the
assistant.</p>

<p>"Aren't you feeling well, Peter dear?" she
asked presently, in an undertone. "You look so
odd!"</p>

<p>"Quite well," he said; "I&mdash;ah!&mdash;was thinking
of something else for the moment, and you startled
me, that's all."</p>

<p>"You had such a far-away expression in your
eyes," said Sophia, "and you did jump so when
I spoke to you; you should really try to conquer
that tendency to let yourself wander, Peter."</p>

<p>"I will, my love," he said; and he meant it,
for he had let himself wander farther than he
quite intended.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><b>The Third Cheque.</b></p>

<p class="pi p1"><i>Good Resolutions.</i>&mdash;<i>Casuistry.</i>&mdash;<i>A Farewell Visit.</i>&mdash;<i>Small
Profit and a Quick Return.</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">As the reader may imagine, this second experience
had an effect upon Peter that
was rather deterrent than encouraging.</p>

<p>It was a painful piece of self-revelation to find
that, had he chosen to avail himself of the extra
hours on board the <i>Boomerang</i> as they occurred,
he would have so employed them as to place
himself in relations of considerable ambiguity
towards two distinct young ladies. How far he
was committed to either, or both, he could not
tell; but he had an uneasy suspicion that neither
of them would have been quite so emotional had
he conducted himself with the same prudence that
had marked his behaviour throughout the time
which he <i>was</i> able to account for.</p>

<p>And yet his conscience acquitted him of any
actual default; if he had ever really had any
passages at all approaching the sentimental with
either Miss Tyrrell or Miss Davenport, his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
could hardly be so utterly blank on the subject as
it certainly was. No; at the worst, his failings
were only potential peccadillos, the kind of weaknesses
he might have given way to if he had not
wisely postponed the hours in which the occasions
were afforded.</p>

<p>He had had a warning, a practical moral lesson
which had merely arrived, as such things often do,
rather after date.</p>

<p>But, so far as it was possible to profit by it, he
would: at least, he would abstain from making
any further inroads upon the balance of extra time
which still remained to his credit at the bank;
he would draw no further cheques; he would
return to that P. and O. steamer no more. For an
engaged man whose wedding-day was approaching
by leaps and bounds, it was, however innocent,
too disturbing and exciting a form of distraction
to be quite safely indulged in.</p>

<p>The resolution cost him something, nevertheless.
Peter was not a man who had hitherto been spoilt
by feminine adoration. Sophia was fond of him,
but she never affected to place him upon any sort
of pinnacle; on the contrary, she looked down
upon him protectingly and indulgently from a
moral and intellectual pedestal of her own. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
had not objected to this, in fact he rather liked it,
but it was less gratifying and stimulating to his
self-esteem than the romantic and idealising sentiments
which he had seemingly inspired in two
exceedingly bewitching young persons with whom
he felt so much in sympathy. It was an agreeable
return from the bread-and-butter of engaged life
to the <i>petits fours</i> of semi-flirtation. After all, Peter
was but human, and a man is seldom esteemed for
being otherwise. He could not help a natural
regret at having to abandon experiences which,
judging from the fragmentary samples he had
obtained, promised so much and such varied
interest. That the interest was not consecutive,
only made it the more amusing,&mdash;it was a living
puzzle-picture, the pieces of which he could fit
together as he received them. It was tantalising
to look at his cheque-book and feel that upon its
leaves the rest of the story was written, but that
he must never seek to decipher it: it became
so tantalising, that he locked the cheque-book up
at last.</p>

<p>But already some of the edge had worn off his
resolution, and he had begun to see only the more
seductive side of interviews which, at the time,
had not been free from difficulty and embarrassment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Having put himself beyond the reach of temptation,
he naturally began to cast about for some
excuse for again exposing himself to it.</p>

<p>It was the eve of his wedding-day; he was in
his chambers for the last time, and alone, for he
would not see Sophia again until he met her in
bridal array at the church door, and he had no
bachelor friends whom he cared to invite to help
him to keep up his spirits.</p>

<p>Peter was horribly restless and nervous; he
needed a sedative of some kind, and even trying
on his wedding garments failed to soothe him, as
he felt almost certain there was a wrinkle between
the shoulders, and it was too late to have it
altered.</p>

<p>The idea of one more visit to the <i>Boomerang</i>,&mdash;one
more interview, the last, with one or other of his
amiable and fascinating friends&mdash;it did not matter
very much which,&mdash;presented itself in a more and
more attractive light. If it did nothing else, it
would provide him with something to think about
for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>Was it courteous, was it even right, to drop his
friends without the slightest apology or explanation?
Ought he not, as a gentleman and a man
of honour, to go back and bid them "Good-bye"?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Peter, after carefully considering the point, discovered
that it was clearly his duty to perform
this trifling act of civility.</p>

<p>As soon as he had settled that, he got out his
cheque-book from the despatch-box, in which he
had placed it for his own security, and, sitting
down just as he was, drew another fifteen minutes,
and cashed them, like the first, at the ormolu
clock....</p>

<p>This time he found himself sitting on a cushioned
bench in the music-room of the <i>Boomerang</i>. It was
shortly after sunset, as he could tell from the bar
of dusky crimson against the violet sea, which,
framed in the ports opposite, rose and sank with
each roll of the ship. There was a swell on, and
she rolled more than he could have wished.</p>

<p>As he expected, he was not alone; but, as he
had <i>not</i> expected, his companion was neither Miss
Tyrrell nor Miss Davenport, but a grim and portly
matron, who was eyeing him with a look of strong
disfavour, which made Peter wish he had not
come. "What," he wondered, "was he in for
now?" His uneasiness was increased as he
glanced down upon his trousers, which, being new
and of a delicate lavender tint, reminded him that
in his impatience he had come away in his wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
garments. He feared that he must present rather
an odd appearance on board ship in this festal
attire; but there he would have to stay for the next
quarter of an hour, and he must make the best of it.</p>

<p>"I repeat, Mr. Tourmalin," said the matron,
"you are doubtless not unprepared for the fact
that I have requested a few minutes' private
conversation with you?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said Peter, quaking already at
this alarming opening, "but I am&mdash;very much
unprepared." "Surely," he thought, "this could
not be <i>another</i> dear friend? No, that was too
absurd&mdash;he must have drawn the line <i>somewhere</i>!"</p>

<p>"Then permit me to enlighten you," she said
raspingly. "I sent for you, at a time when we
are least likely to be interrupted, to demand an
explanation from you upon a very delicate and
painful matter which has recently come to my
knowledge."</p>

<p>"<i>Oh!</i>" said Peter&mdash;and nothing more. He
guessed her purpose at once: she was going
to ask him his intentions with regard to her
daughter! He could have wished for some indication
as to whether she was Lady Tyrrell or
Mrs. Davenport; but, as he had none at present,
"Oh" seemed the safest remark to make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Life on board a large passenger-ship, Mr.
Tourmalin," she went on to observe, "though
relaxed in some respects, is still not without
decencies which a gentleman is bound to respect."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Peter, unable to discover the
bearings which lay in the application of this particular
observation.</p>

<p>"You <i>say</i> 'Quite so'; but what has your
<i>behaviour</i> been, sir?"</p>

<p>"That," said Peter, "is exactly what I should
like to know myself!"</p>

<p>"A true gentleman would have considered the
responsibility he incurred by giving currency to
idle and malicious gossip!"</p>

<p>His apprehensions were correct then: it <i>was</i>
one of the young ladies' mothers&mdash;but <i>which?</i></p>

<p>"I can only assure you, madam," he began,
"that if unhappily I have&mdash;er&mdash;been the
means of furnishing gossip, it has been entirely
unintentional."</p>

<p>She seemed so much mollified by this, that he
proceeded with more confidence:</p>

<p>"As to anything I may have said to your
daughter&mdash;&mdash;" when she almost bounded from her
seat with fury.</p>

<p>"My <i>daughter</i>, sir! Do you mean to sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
there and tell me that you had the audacity to
so much as hint of such a thing to my daughter, of
all people?"</p>

<p>"So&mdash;so much depends on who your daughter
is!" said Peter, completely losing his head.</p>

<p>"You dared to strike this cruel and unmanly
blow at the self-respect of a sensitive girl&mdash;to
poison her defenceless ears with your false,
dastardly insinuations&mdash;and you can actually
admit it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I can admit it or not
yet," he replied. "And&mdash;and you do put things
so very strongly! It is like this: if you are
referring to any conversation I may have had
with Miss Tyrrell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Miss Tyrrell?</i> You have told her <i>too!</i>" exclaimed
this terrible old matron, thereby demonstrating
that, at least, she was not Lady Tyrrell.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I <i>should</i> have said Miss Davenport," said
Peter, correcting himself precipitately.</p>

<p>"Miss Davenport as well? Upon my word!
And pray, sir, may I ask how many other ladies
on board this ship are in possession of your
amiable confidences?"</p>

<p>He raised his hands in utter despair.</p>

<p>"I can't say," he groaned. "I don't really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
know what I may have said, or whom I may have
said it to! I&mdash;I seem to have done so much in
my spare time, but I never meant anything!"</p>

<p>"It may be so," she said; "indeed, you hardly
seem to me accountable for your actions or you
would not appear in such a ridiculous costume
as that, with a sprig of orange-blossom in your
button-hole and a high hat, too!"</p>

<p>"I quite feel," said Peter, blushing, "that such a
costume must strike you as inappropriate; but&mdash;but
I happened to be trying them on, and&mdash;rather
than keep you waiting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, sir, never mind your costume&mdash;the
question is, if you are genuinely anxious to
repair the wrong you have done, what course do
you propose to take?"</p>

<p>"I will be perfectly frank with you, madam,"
said Peter: "I am not in a position to repair any
wrong I have done&mdash;if I <i>have</i> done any wrong
(which I don't admit)&mdash;by taking any course
whatever!"</p>

<p>"You are <i>not</i>!" she cried. "And you tell me
so to my face?"</p>

<p>After all, reflected Peter, why should he be
afraid of this old lady? In a few more minutes
he would be many hundreds of miles away, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
he would take very good care not to come back
again. He felt master of the situation, and determined
to brazen it out.</p>

<p>"I do, madam!" he said, crossing his legs in an
easy fashion, "Look at it from a reasonable point
of view. There is safety in numbers; and if I
have been so unfortunate as to give several young
ladies here an entirely erroneous impression, I
must leave it to you to undeceive them as considerately
but distinctly as you can. For me
to make any selection would only create ill-feeling
among the rest; and their own good
sense will show them that I am forbidden by the
laws of my country, which I am the last person to
set at defiance,&mdash;that I am forbidden (even if I
were free in other respects, which I am not) to
marry them all!"</p>

<p>"The only possible explanation of your conduct
is, that you are not in your right mind!"
she said. "Who in the world spoke or dreamed
of your marrying any one of them? Certainly
not <i>I</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Peter, hopelessly fogged once
more. "I thought I might unintentionally have
given them grounds for some such expectation.
I'm very glad I was mistaken. You see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
you must really make allowances for my utter
ignorance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If this idiotic behaviour is not a mere
feint, sir, I can make allowances for much;
but, surely, you are at least sufficiently in your
proper senses to see how abominably you have
behaved?"</p>

<p>"Have I?" said Peter, submissively. "I don't
wish to contradict you, if you say so, I'm sure.
And, as I have some reason to believe that my
stay on board this ship will not last very much
longer, I should like before I go to express my
very sincere regret."</p>

<p>"There is an easy way of proving your sincerity,
sir, if you choose to avail yourself of it," she said.
"I find it very difficult to believe, from the evident
feebleness of your intellect, that you can be the
person chiefly responsible for this scandal. Am I
correct in my supposition?"</p>

<p>"You are, madam," said Peter. "I should
never have got myself into such a tangle as this,
if I had not been talked over by Mr. Perkins. I don't
know if I can succeed in making myself clear, for
the whole business is rather complicated; but I
can try to explain it, if you will only have a little
patience."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have said quite enough," she said. "I
know all I wish to know now. So it was Mr.
Perkins, who has been using you as his instrument,
was it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Peter; "but for him, nothing
of this would have happened."</p>

<p>"You will have no objection to repeating that
statement, should I call upon you to do so?"</p>

<p>"No," said Peter, who observed with pleasure
that her wrath against himself was almost entirely
moderated; "but you will have to call <i>soon</i>, or I
shall have gone. I&mdash;I don't know if I shall have
another opportunity of meeting Mr. Perkins; but
if I did, I should certainly tell him that I do <i>not</i>
consider he has treated me quite fairly. He has
put me in what I may call a false position, in
<i>several</i> false positions; and if I had had the knowledge
I have now, I should have had nothing to
do with him from the first. He entirely misled
me over this business!"</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," she said; "you have shown
a more gentlemanly spirit, on the whole, than I
expected. I am glad to find that your evil has
been wrought more by want of thought than heart.
It will be for you to complete your reparation
when the proper time arrives. In the meantime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
let this be a warning to you, sir, never
to&mdash;&mdash;" ...</p>

<p>But here Peter made the sudden discovery that
he was no longer in the music-room of the
<i>Boomerang</i>, but at home in his old easy-chair by
his bachelor fireside.</p>

<p>"Phew!" he muttered to himself, "that was a
bad quarter of an hour while it lasted! What an
old she-dragon it was! But she's right&mdash;it <i>is</i> a
warning to me. I mustn't&mdash;I really must <i>not</i> draw
any more of these confounded time cheques. I've
made that ship too hot to hold me already! I'd
better remain for ever in contented ignorance of
how I spent that extra time, than go on getting
into one mess after another like this! It was a
wonder I got out of this one as well as I did; but
evidently that old woman knew what Perkins is,
and saw <i>I</i> wasn't to blame. Now she'll explain
the whole affair to all those girls (whoever they
may be), and pitch into Perkins&mdash;and serve him
right! <i>I'm</i> out of it, at any rate; and now, thank
goodness, after to-morrow I shall have nothing to
do but live contentedly and happily with dearest
Sophia! I'd better burn this beastly cheque-book&mdash;I
shall never want it again!"</p>

<p>It would have been well for Peter if he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
burnt that cheque-book; but when it came to the
point, he could not bring himself to destroy it.
After all, it was an interesting <i>souvenir</i> of some
very curious, if not unique, experiences; and, as
such, he decided to preserve it.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><b>The Fourth Cheque.</b></p>

<p class="pi p1"><i>A Blue Moon.&mdash;Felicity in a Flat.&mdash;Practical Astronomy.&mdash;Temptation
and a Relapse.&mdash;The Difficulties
of being Completely Candid.&mdash;A Slight Misunderstanding.&mdash;The
Avenging Orange.</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">Peter Tourmalin enjoyed his honeymoon
extremely, in a calm, sober, and
rational manner. Sophia discouraged rapture;
but, on the other hand, no one was better
fitted to inspire and sustain an intelligent interest
in the wonders of Geology; and, catching her
scientific enthusiasm, Peter spent many happy
hours with her along the cliffs, searching for fossil
remains. In fact, the only cloud that threatened
to mar their felicity at all was an unfortunate
tendency on his part to confuse a trilobite with
a graptolite, a blunder for which Sophia had no
tolerance. He was hazy about his periods, too,
until she sent up to town for Lyell's great work
on the subject as a birthday surprise for him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
he read it aloud to her on the sands. Altogether,
it was a peaceful, happy time.</p>

<p>And never once in the whole course of his
honeymoon did he seriously entertain the possibility
of making any further use of his book of blank
Time Cheques. If he had contemplated it, no
harm would have been done, however, as the book
was lying amongst his neglected papers at his
former chambers.</p>

<p>He felt no poignant regret when the month came
to an end, and they returned to town to take
possession of their Marylebone flat: for what was
it but shifting the scene of their happiness? And
after this had taken place, Peter was still too
much occupied to have leisure for idle and mischievous
thoughts. Marrying Sophia was, indeed,
like loving Sir Richard Steele's fair lady, "a
liberal education;" and Peter enjoyed the undivided
benefit of her rare talent for instruction.</p>

<p>He had been giving his attention to Astronomy
of late, an unguarded remark of his having
betrayed to Sophia the extreme crudity of his
ideas respecting that science, and she had insisted
upon his getting a popular primer, with diagrams,
and mastering it as a preliminary to deeper study.</p>

<p>One evening he was in the smaller room of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
two that, divided by an arch, served for study
and drawing-room combined; and he was busily
engaged in working out a simple practical illustration,
by the aid of one of the aforesaid diagrams.
The experiment required a lamp, a ball of cotton,
and an orange transfixed by a knitting-needle,
and it had something to do with the succession
of the seasons, solar and lunar eclipses, and the
varying lengths of day and night on different
portions of our globe, though he was not very
clear what.</p>

<p>"Don't you find you understand the inclination
of the moon's orbit to the plane of the ecliptic
better now?" said Sophia, as she came through
the arch.</p>

<p>"I think I shall, as soon as I can get the moon
to keep steadier," he said, with more hope than he
felt; "and it's rather hard to remember whereabouts
I am supposed to be on this orange."</p>

<p>"I must get you something to make that clearer,"
she said; "and you haven't tilted the orange
nearly enough. But leave it for a moment; I've
brought you in this packet of letters and things
the people at your old rooms have just sent down.
I wish, while I am away&mdash;I shall be back in a
minute,&mdash;you would just run over them, and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
me if there are any papers you want kept, or if
they may all be burnt."</p>

<p>While she was gone, he undid the string which
fastened the packet, and found, at the bottom of a
mass of bills and documents of no value, the small
oblong cheque-book which he had vowed never to
see again. Somehow, as his eyes rested on its
green cover, the old longing came upon him for a
complete change of air and scene. He felt as if
he <i>must</i> get away from that orange: there were no
lamps but electric lights, and no oranges, on board
the <i>Boomerang</i>.</p>

<p>But then, his last visit had not turned out a
success: what if he were to find he had drawn
another quarter of an hour with that irate matron
of the music-room?</p>

<p>However, he had left her, as he remembered, in
a comparatively pacific mood. She understood
him better now; and besides, thanks to the highly
erratic system (if there was any system) on which
the payments were made, the chances were immensely
against his coming across the same old
lady twice running. He thought he would risk
that.</p>

<p>It was much more likely that he would meet
Miss Tyrrell or Miss Davenport, or it might even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
be another person to whom he was unconsciously
allied by the bond of dear friendship. The only
question was, how far he could trust himself in
such companionship. But here he felt himself
guilty of a self-distrust that was unworthy of him.
If, on the two previous occasions, he could not call
to mind that he had entertained any deeper
sentiment for either young lady than a cordial and
sympathetic interest, was it likely that, now he
was a married man, he would be more susceptible?
He was as devoted to his Sophia as ever,
but the wear and tear of several successive evenings
spent in elementary Astronomy were telling upon
his constitution. Such high thinking did not agree
with him: he wanted a plainer mental diet for a
change. Fifteen minutes spent in the society of
someone with a mind rather less cultivated than
his wife's would be very restful. Then, when he
came back, he would give his whole mind to the
orange again.</p>

<p>In short, all Peter's good resolutions were thrown
overboard once more, and he wrote out a cheque
for the usual amount in desperate fear lest Sophia
might return before he could get it honoured. He
felt a certain compunction, even then, in presenting
it to the severe and intensely respectable black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
marble timepiece which recorded the flying hours
of his domestic bliss. He almost doubted whether
it would countenance so irregular a proceeding;
but, although it was on the verge of striking nine,
it cashed the cheque without hesitation....</p>

<p>It was mid-day: Peter was sitting on a folding
seat, protected from the scorching sun by the
awning which was stretched above and along the
exposed side of the deck, and, to his great satisfaction,
he found Miss Tyrrell reclining in a deck-chair
between himself and the railing, and a
pleasant picture of fresh and graceful girlhood she
presented.</p>

<p>As usual, he was not in time for the beginning
of the conversation, for she was evidently commenting
upon something he had said.</p>

<p>"How delightful it sounds!" she was saying,
"and what a free, unfettered kind of life yours
must be, Mr. Tourmalin, from your description!"</p>

<p>Now, this was awkward; because he must have
been giving her an airy description of his existence
as the bachelor and butterfly he had ceased to be.
He answered guardedly, awaiting his opportunity
to lead up to a disclosure of the change in his
circumstances since they had last met.</p>

<p>"It is pleasant enough," he said. "A little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
dull at times, perhaps," he added, thinking of the
orange.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't expect me to pity you!" she
said. "I don't believe you need ever be dull,
unless you choose. There must always be friends
who are glad to see you."</p>

<p>"I am glad to think," said Peter, "that, when
I do feel dull, I have at least one friend&mdash;one dear
friend&mdash;from whom I may count upon a welcome!"</p>

<p>He accompanied this speech with such a look,
that she could not well pretend to mistake his
meaning; and the next moment he regretted it,
for he saw he had gone too far.</p>

<p>"That is a very pretty speech," she said, with a
faint flush; "but isn't it a little premature, Mr.
Tourmalin, considering that we have scarcely
known one another two days!"</p>

<p>For the moment, Peter had forgotten the want
of consecutiveness in these eccentric Time Cheques.
This interview should by rights have preceded
the first he had had with her. He felt annoyed
with himself, and still more with the unbusinesslike
behaviour of the Bank.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was anticipating, perhaps," he said. "But
I assure you that we shall certainly <i>be</i> friends&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
may even go so far as to say, dear friends&mdash;sooner
or later. You see if I am not right!"</p>

<p>Miss Tyrrell smiled.</p>

<p>"Are you sure," she said, with her eyes demurely
lowered&mdash;"are you sure that there is nobody who
might object to our being on quite such intimate
terms as that?"</p>

<p>Peter started. Could she possibly have guessed,
and how much did she know?</p>

<p>"There could be nothing for anybody to object
to," he said. "Are you&mdash;er&mdash;referring to any
person in particular?"</p>

<p>She still kept her eyes down, but then she was
occupied just at the moment in removing a loose
splinter of bamboo from the arm of her chair.</p>

<p>"You mustn't think me curious or&mdash;or indiscreet,
if I tell you," she said; "but before I knew you
to speak to, I&mdash;I couldn't help noticing how often,
as you sat on deck, you used to pull something
out of your pocket and look at it."</p>

<p>"My watch?" suggested Peter, feeling uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"No, not your watch; it looked more like&mdash;well,
like a photograph."</p>

<p>"It may have been a photograph, now you
mention it," he admitted. "Well, Miss Tyrrell?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
"Well," she said, "I often amuse myself by
making up stories about people I meet&mdash;quite
strangers, I mean. And, do you know, I made up
my mind that that photograph was the portrait of
someone&mdash;some lady you are engaged to. I should
so much like to know if I was right or not?"</p>

<p>Here was Peter's opportunity of revealing his
real status, and preventing all chance of future
misunderstanding. It was not too late; but still
it might be best and kindest to break the news
gradually.</p>

<p>"You were partly right and partly wrong," he
said: "that was the portrait of a lady I was&mdash;er&mdash;<i>once</i>
engaged to."</p>

<p>Unless Peter was very much mistaken, there
was a new light in her face, an added brightness
in her soft grey eyes as she raised them for an
instant before resuming her labours upon the
wicker-chair.</p>

<p>"Then you mean," she said softly, "that the
engagement is broken off?"</p>

<p>Peter began to recognise that explanation was a
less simple affair than it had seemed. If he said
that he was no longer engaged but <i>married</i> to the
original of that photograph, she would naturally
want to know why he had just led her to believe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
as he must have done, that he was still a careless
and unattached bachelor: she would ask <i>when</i> and
<i>where</i> he was married; and how could he give a
straightforward and satisfactory answer to such
questions?</p>

<p>And then another side of the case struck him.
As a matter of fact he was undeniably married;
but would he be strictly correct in describing himself
as being so <i>in this particular interview?</i> It
belonged properly to the time he had made the
voyage home, and he was certainly not married
<i>then</i>.</p>

<p>In the difficulty he was in, he thought it best
to go on telling the truth until it became absolutely
impossible, and then fall back on invention.</p>

<p>"The fact is, Miss Tyrrell," he said, "that I can't
be absolutely certain whether the engagement is
ended or not at this precise moment."</p>

<p>Her face was alive with the sweetest sympathy.</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Tourmalin!" she said, "how horribly
anxious you must be to get back and
know!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Peter, "yes, I&mdash;I shall know when
I get home, I suppose."</p>

<p>And he sighed; for the orange recurred once
more to his reluctant memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't tell me if it pains you too much," she
said gently. "I only ask because I do feel so sorry
for you. Do you think that, when you do get
home, you will find her married?"</p>

<p>"I have every reason for believing so," he said.</p>

<p>"That will be a terrible blow for you, of
course?"</p>

<p>"A blow?" said Peter, forgetting himself.
"Good gracious me, no! Why <i>should</i> it be? I&mdash;I
mean, I shall be prepared for it, don't you
know!"</p>

<p>"Then it's not so bad after all?" she said.</p>

<p>"It's not at all bad!" said Peter, with a vague
intention of loyalty to Sophia. "I like it!"</p>

<p>"I think I understand," she said slowly: "you
will not be sorry to find she has married; but she
may tell you that she never had the least intention
of letting you go so easily?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, "she may tell me that, certainly"&mdash;("if
she finds out where I've been," he
added, mentally).</p>

<p>"And," she continued, "what would you do
then?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said&mdash;"I suppose I should
have to do whatever she wished."</p>

<p>"Yes!" she agreed warmly, "you <i>will</i> do that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
even if it costs you something, won't you? Because
it will be the only right, the only honourable
course to take&mdash;you will be the happier for it in
the end, Mr. Tourmalin, I am sure you will!"</p>

<p>After all, it seemed to him that she must understand
about the Time Cheques&mdash;or, why should she
urge him to give them up if Sophia demanded
such a sacrifice?</p>

<p>"No, I shall not," he said; "I shall miss these
times terribly. You don't know what they are to
me, or you wouldn't speak like that!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Tourmalin!" she cried, "I&mdash;I must not
listen to you! You can't possibly mean what you
seem to mean. It is wrong&mdash;wrong to me, and
wrong to her&mdash;to say things that&mdash;that, for all you
know, you are not free to say! Don't let me think
badly of you!"</p>

<p>Peter was absolutely horrified! What had he
said to agitate her like that? He had merely
meant to express the pleasure he found in these
brief and stolen visits to the <i>Boomerang;</i> and she
had misconstrued him like this! At all hazards,
he must explain now, if it took him days to make
it clear.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Tyrrell," he protested earnestly,
"you quite misunderstood me&mdash;you did, indeed!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Pray be calm, and I will endeavour to make my
position a little clearer than I'm afraid I have
done. The worst of it is," he added, "that the
whole thing has got into such a muddle that, for
the life of me, I can't exactly make out what my
position is at the present moment!"</p>

<p>"You can if you will only recollect that you are
this mourning-pin," said a familiar voice; and,
with the abruptness characteristic of the Time
Cheque system, he was back in his study, staring
at the ground glass globe of the lamp and the
transfixed orange. The clock behind him was
striking nine, and Sophia was offering him a pin
with a big black head.</p>

<p>"Oh! am I the mourning-pin?" he repeated,
helplessly.</p>

<p>"Really, Peter," said Sophia, "I think the pin,
just at this moment, has the more intelligent
expression of the two. Do try to look a little less
idiotic! Now, see; you stick the pin into the
orange to represent your point of view, and then
keep on twirling it slowly round."</p>

<p>So Peter twirled the orange slowly round for
the remainder of the evening, though his thoughts
were far away with Miss Tyrrell. He was wondering
what she could have thought of him, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
worse still, what she would think if she could see
him as he was employed at that moment?</p>

<p>"I tell you what we must do, Peter,&mdash;when you
get a little more advanced," said Sophia, enthusiastically,
that evening, "we must see if we can't
pick up a small secondhand orrery somewhere&mdash;it
would be so nice to have one!"</p>

<p>"Oh, delightful!" he said, absently.</p>

<p>He was not very clear as to what an orrery
was, unless it was the dusty machine that was
worked with handles at sundry Assembly-room
lectures he had attended in early youth. But of
one thing he felt grimly certain&mdash;that it was something
which would render it necessary to draw
more Time Cheques!</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><b>Periodic Drawings.</b></p>

<p class="pi p1"><i>A Series of Cheques: their Advantages and Drawbacks.&mdash;An
Unknown Factor.&mdash;Uncompleted Confidences.&mdash;Ibsen,
with Intervals.&mdash;A Disappointment.&mdash;A
"Search-question" from Sophia.&mdash;Confidence
Restored'.</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">Whether it was natural sin on Peter's
part, or an excusable spirit of revolt
against the oppression of an orrery
which Sophia succeeded in picking up a great
bargain at an auction somewhere, his drafts on
the Anglo-Australian Joint Stock Time Bank
Limited did not end with the one recorded in
the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>And, which was more discreditable still, he no
longer pretended to himself that he meant to
stop until his balance was completely exhausted.
His only care now was to economise, to regulate
his expenditure by spreading his drawings over
as long a period as possible. With this object
he made a careful calculation, and found there were
still several hours to his credit; whereupon, lest he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
should yield to the temptation of drawing too
much at any one time, he made out a number of
cheques for fifteen minutes apiece, and limited
himself to one a week&mdash;an allowance which, even
under the severest provocation, he rarely permitted
himself to exceed.</p>

<p>These weekly excursions, short as they were,
were a source of the greatest comfort to him,
especially now that he had thrown off any idea
of moral responsibility.</p>

<p>By degrees he possessed himself of most of the
back-numbers, if they may be so termed, of his dual
romance. At one time, he found himself being
presented by the grateful Sir William to his
daughter; and now that he knew what service he
had rendered the Judge, he was less at sea than
he would certainly have been otherwise. Another
time, he discovered himself in the act of dragging
Miss Davenport unceremoniously back from the
bulwarks; but here again his memory furnished
him with the proper excuse for conduct which,
considering that he was not supposed to be acquainted
with her, he might have found it difficult
to account for satisfactorily. So, after all, there
did seem to be a sort of method in the operation
of the Time Cheques, arbitrary as it appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>One fact that went far to reconcile him to his
own conscience was the circumstance that, though
the relations he stood in towards both young
ladies varied at each interview with the most
bewildering uncertainty, so that one week he
would be upon the closest and most confidential
terms, and the next be thrown back into the conventional
formality of a first introduction&mdash;these
relations never again approached the dangerous
level of sentiment which had so alarmed him.</p>

<p>He flattered himself that the judicious attitude
he was adopting to both was correcting the false
impressions which might have&mdash;and for that
matter actually had&mdash;been given.</p>

<p>He was always pleased to see them again,
whichever one it was; they were simply charming
friends&mdash;frank, natural, unaffected girls&mdash;and
not too clever. Sometimes, indeed, he recognised,
and did his best to discourage, symptoms of a
dawning tenderness on their part which it was
not in his power to reciprocate.</p>

<p>Peter was in no danger of losing his heart to
either; possibly the attractions of each served as
a conductor to protect him from the influence of
the other. He enjoyed their society, their evident
appreciation of all he said and did, but that was all;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and as they recognised that there could be no
closer bond than that of cordial friendship between
them, he was relieved of all misgivings.</p>

<p>Surely it was a blameless and legitimate
manner, even for a married man, of spending the
idle moments which belonged properly to the
days of his bachelorhood! Still, he did not confide
this harmless secret of his to Sophia; he
might tell her when it was all over, but not so
long as her disapproval could affect his plans.
And he had an instinct that such a story as he
had to tell would fail to appeal to a person of her
accurately logical habit of mind.</p>

<p>So, on one occasion when he discovered that he
had lost one of the loose cheques he now carried
constantly about with him, it was with a feeling
very like panic that he reflected that he might
have dropped it about the house, where its unusual
form would inevitably provoke Sophia's
curiosity; and he was much reassured when he
was able to conclude, from the fact that she made
no reference to it, that he must have lost it out of
doors.</p>

<p>It must have been some time after this before
his serenity again met with a slight shock: he
was walking up and down the deck with Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Davenport&mdash;it happened to be one of the days
when he knew her very well indeed.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," she was saying, "I feel as if
I <i>must</i> speak to somebody!"</p>

<p>"You know where you will always find a very
willing listener!" he said, with a kind of fatherly
floweriness that he felt sat well upon him.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean you," she said,&mdash;"to some girl
of my own age, I meant."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Peter, "well, that's a very
natural feeling, I'm sure. I can quite understand
it!"</p>

<p>"Then you wouldn't mind&mdash;you wouldn't be
angry if I did?" she said, looking up at him with
her great childishly serious eyes.</p>

<p>"My dear child," said Peter, getting more
fatherly every moment, "how could I possibly
object to your speaking to any lady on board if
you want to?"</p>

<p>He would have liked to make one or two
exceptions, perhaps; but he thought he had
better not.</p>

<p>"I am so glad," she said, "because I did&mdash;this
very morning. I did so want someone to advise
me&mdash;to tell me what a girl ought to do, what
she would do herself in my place."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" said Peter, sympathetically, "it is&mdash;er&mdash;a
difficult position for you, no doubt."</p>

<p>"And for you, too!" she said quickly; "remember
that."</p>

<p>"And for me <i>too</i>, of course," said Peter, assenting,
as he always did now from habit, to anything he
did not understand at the moment. "My position
might be described as one of&mdash;er&mdash;difficulty, certainly.
And so you asked advice about yours, eh?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't very well help myself," she said.
"There was a girl, a little older than I am, perhaps,
sitting next to me on deck, and she mentioned
your name, and somehow&mdash;I hardly know how it
came about&mdash;but she seemed so kind, and so interested
in it all, that&mdash;that I believe I told her
everything.... You aren't <i>angry</i> with me,
are you, Peter?"</p>

<p>She had been making a <i>confidante</i> of Miss Tyrrell!
It was awkward, extremely awkward and annoying,
if, as he began to fear, her confidences were
of a tender character.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am not exactly angry," he said; "but I
do think you might be more careful whom you
speak to. What did you tell her?"</p>

<p>"<i>All!</i>" she said, with the same little quiver in
her underlip he had noticed before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is no answer," said Peter (it certainly
was none for him). "Tell me <i>what</i> you said?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I told her about you, and about me ...
and&mdash;and about <i>him!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Peter, "about me, and you, and
him? Well, and&mdash;and how did she <i>take</i> it?"</p>

<p>"She didn't say very much; she turned very
pale. It was rather rough at the time, and I don't
think she can be a very good sailor; for before I
had even finished she got up and went below,
and I haven't seen her since."</p>

<p>"But you told her about 'him'?" he persisted;
"and when you say 'him,' I presume you refer
to&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Here he paused expectantly.</p>

<p>"Of course!" she answered, with a touch of
impatience. "Whom else should I be <i>likely</i> to
refer to?"</p>

<p>"It's excessively absurd!" said Peter, driven to
candour at last. "I&mdash;I remember perfectly that
you did mention all the circumstances at the time:
but I've a shocking memory for names; and, just
for the minute, I&mdash;I find it difficult to recall where
'he' comes in exactly. Curious, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Curious?" she said, passionately; "it's
<i>abominable!</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is," agreed Peter; "I quite admit that I
<i>ought</i> to know&mdash;only, I <i>don't</i>."</p>

<p>"This is cruel, unmanly!" she said, brokenly.
"How <i>could</i> you forget&mdash;how can you insult
me by <i>pretending</i> that you could forget such a
thing as that? It is odious of you to make a&mdash;a
joke of it all, when you know perfectly well
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my dear young lady!" he declared, as
she left her speech unfinished, "I am as far from
any disposition to be jocular as ever I was in my
life. Let me beg you to be a little more explicit.
We seem to have got into a trifling misunderstanding,
which, I am sure, a little patience will easily
put right." ...</p>

<p>"Put right?" said Sophia, behind him. "I was
not aware, Peter, that the clock was out of order.
What is the matter with it?"</p>

<p>He almost staggered back from the chimneypiece,
upon which he had found himself leaning in
an attitude of earnest persuasion.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was only thinking, my love," he said,
"that it wanted regulating."</p>

<p>"If it does," said Sophia, "you are hardly the
proper person to do it, Peter. The less you meddle
with it the better, I should think!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps so, my dear Sophia, perhaps so!"
said Peter, sitting down with the utmost docility.</p>

<p>He had narrowly escaped exciting suspicion.
It was fortunate that there was nothing compromising
in the few words she had overheard,
but he must not allow himself to be caught so
near the clock again.</p>

<p>He was not a little disturbed by the tenor of
this last interview. It was bad enough that in
some way he seemed to have seriously displeased
Miss Davenport; but, besides that, he could not
contemplate without uneasiness the probable effect
which her confidences, whatever their exact purport,
might have upon Miss Tyrrell. For hitherto
he had seen no necessity to mention to one young
lady that he was even distantly acquainted with
the other. As he never by any chance drew them
both together, there seemed no object in volunteering
such information.</p>

<p>But this only made him more apprehensive of
a scene when his next turn with Miss Tyrrell
arrived. Perhaps, he thought, it would be wiser
to keep away from the <i>Boomerang</i> for a week or
two, and give them all time to calm down a
little.</p>

<p>However, he had the moral, or rather the immoral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
courage to present a cheque as usual at the
end of the next week, with results that were even
less in accordance with his anticipations than
before.</p>

<p>It came about in this way: He was comfortably
seated by the fireplace opposite Sophia in a cosy
domesticated fashion, and was reading to her
aloud; for he had been let off the orrery that
evening. The book he was reading by Sophia's
particular request was Ibsen's <i>Doll's House</i>, and
it was not the fault of the subject (which interested
her deeply), but of Peter's elocution, which was
poor, that, on glancing from the text, he found
that she had sunk into a profound and peaceful
slumber.</p>

<p>It was a chance he had been waiting for all
day. He was rather tired of Nora, with her
innocence and her macaroons, her tarantella and
her taradiddles, her forgery and her fancy dress,
and he had the cheque by him in readiness; so
he stole on tiptoe to the mantelpiece, slipped the
paper under the clock, and was just in time to
sink back into his easy-chair, before it turned out
to be one of the revolving-seats in the dining-saloon
on the <i>Boomerang</i>.</p>

<p>There was a tumbler of whisky-and-seltzer on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the table in front of him, and he was sitting in close
confabulation with his former acquaintance, Mr.
Perkins, the Bank Manager.</p>

<p>"That's precisely what I don't know, sir, and
what I'm determined to find out!" were the first
words he heard from the latter gentleman, who
looked flushed and angry. "But it's a scandalous
thing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Very," said Peter, rather bored and deeply
disappointed; for the Manager was but an indifferent
substitute for the companion he had
been counting upon. "Oh, very!"</p>

<p>"Have you happened to hear anything said
about it yourself?" inquired his friend.</p>

<p>"Not a word!" said Peter, with the veracity
he always endeavoured to maintain on these
occasions.</p>

<p>"To go and shift a statement of that kind on to
my shoulders like that, it's like the fellow's confounded
impudence!"</p>

<p>For the moment Peter felt a twinge: could the
other be referring to anything he had said himself
in the music-room? But the Manager was evidently
not angry with <i>him</i>, so it must be some
other fellow. Only, Peter decided not to allude
to the faulty working of the Time Cheques, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
had half-intended to do. Perkins was not in the
mood for remonstrances just then.</p>

<p>"Most impudent, I must say," he replied.
"By-the-way," he added carelessly, "what was
the statement exactly?"</p>

<p>"Why, God bless my soul, sir!" cried the
Manager, with unnecessary vehemence, "haven't
I been telling you the whole story? Didn't you
just ask me who the fellow was who has brought
me into this business?"</p>

<p>"So I did," said Peter, "and&mdash;and who <i>was</i>
he?"</p>

<p>"Your attention seems very wandering this
evening! Why, I told you the old woman
wouldn't give me his name."</p>

<p>Peter's alarm returned at this allusion to an old
woman: what old woman could it be but the
terrible matron whom he had encountered in the
music-room? However, it was fortunate that she
had not mentioned any names: if Perkins knew
that he had put all the blame of his entanglements
upon the Manager's broad shoulders, he would
certainly consider it an ungrateful return for what
was intended as a kindness.</p>

<p>"So you said before," he remarked; "some
old women are so obstinate!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Obstinate? That's the first sensible remark
you've made for a long while!" said his candid
friend. "I should think she was obstinate! Why,
I talked myself hoarse trying to make that old
harridan believe that I was as innocent as an
unborn babe of any responsibility for this precious
scandal&mdash;that I'd never so much as heard it
breathed till she told me of it: but it wasn't any
good, sir; she would have it that I was the
originator!"</p>

<p>("So you were!" thought Peter, though he
prudently refrained from saying so.)</p>

<p>"She's going to kick up the dooce's own delight
as soon as she meets her brother; and all I could
get her to say was that then, and not till then, she
would give me an opportunity of having it out
with the cowardly villain, whoever he may be,
that has dared to lay all this gossip at <i>my</i> door!"</p>

<p>Peter did not quarrel with this arrangement of
the old lady's, for he would certainly not be on
board the <i>Boomerang</i> when she arrived at Plymouth.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, with as much interest as he
could display in a subject that did not concern
him, "he'll find that unpleasant, I daresay."</p>

<p>"I think he will!" said Mr. Perkins, emphatically.
"Unless he retracts his infamous calumny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
I&mdash;I'll kick him from one end of the ship to the
other!"</p>

<p>Involuntarily Peter's eyes sought his friend's
boots, which, as he sat in a corner seat with his
feet extended, were much in evidence; they were
strong, suitable boots, stouter than those generally
worn on a sea-voyage, and Peter could not repress
a slight shudder.</p>

<p>"From one end of the ship to the other," he
repeated; "that&mdash;that's rather a long way!"</p>

<p>"Quite long enough for him, though not nearly
long enough for me!" said the Manager. "I'll
teach him to mix me up in these squabbles, when
I find him, sir&mdash;when I find him! Here, steward,
bring some more of these dry biscuits: you'll have
some more, won't you?"</p>

<p>But Peter was not in the vein for dry biscuits at
that moment, and the Manager continued:</p>

<p>"By-the-by, <i>you</i> might help me in this if you
only will. I want to find out if I can before we
reach Gib, who this fellow is, but the less I talk
about the affair the better."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," said Peter. "I&mdash;I wouldn't talk
about it at all, if I were you."</p>

<p>"No, I daresay you're right&mdash;can't be too
careful with an old cat like that. Well, what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
want you to do is to try and find out&mdash;quietly, you
know&mdash;who this infernal fellow is!"</p>

<p>"Well, I daresay I could do that," said Peter.</p>

<p>"No one would think a mild, innocent-looking
little chap like you had any particular motive
for asking: you might ask some of the men in
the smoking-room, and pick up some clue or
other."</p>

<p>"So I might," said Peter,&mdash;"good idea!"</p>

<p>"Or, I'll tell you what&mdash;you might pump the
old lady for me, eh?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I quite care about pumping the
old lady," said Peter, "but anything else I'll do
with pleasure."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the Manager; "that's a good
fellow. I knew I could depend upon you!"</p>

<p>"You can," replied Peter, "though, I fancy,"
he added, soothingly,&mdash;"indeed, I am sure you
will find that the old woman has made a good
deal out of nothing at all." ...</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> old woman, Peter?" asked Sophia with
drowsy asperity. "Not Mrs. Linden, surely!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Linden! Was that the name of the old
she-dragon of the music-room? Why, of course
not; he was in his arm-chair by his own fire,
reading Ibsen to his wife!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, indeed, my love&mdash;it <i>may</i> be Mrs.
Linden," he answered cautiously.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Sophia, crossly. "She's not
meant to be old in the play, and <i>who</i> says 'the old
woman has made a good deal out of nothing'?
Helmer, or Doctor Rank, or Krogstad, or who?
You do read so badly, it's quite impossible to
make out!"</p>

<p>"<i>No</i> one says it, my dear Sophia; at least, it's
not in my edition of the text. You&mdash;you must
have imagined it, I think!"</p>

<p>"I certainly thought I heard you read it out,"
she replied; "but your voice is so monotonous, that
it's just possible I dropped off for a minute or two."</p>

<p>"I dropped off myself about the same time,"
he confessed hypocritically.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't drop off, or allow me to drop
off either, Peter," said Sophia, who was now
thoroughly awake again, "if you felt a more intelligent
interest in the tremendous problem Ibsen
has set in this play. I don't believe you realise
in the least what the lesson is that he means to
teach; now <i>do</i> you, Peter?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not sure that I do altogether, my
love," he admitted.</p>

<p>"I thought as much! What Ibsen insists upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
is, the absolute necessity of one-ness between man
and wife, Peter. They must belong to each other,
complete each other&mdash;they must be Twin Souls.
Are <i>you</i> a Twin Soul, Peter?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, my dear, I can't say!" he
replied, in some perplexity. In the present very
divided state of his sympathies, he could not help
thinking that his Soul was more like a Triplet.</p>

<p>"But think," persisted Sophia, earnestly: "have
you shared all your Past with me? Is there nothing
you have kept back&mdash;no feelings, no experiences,
which you confine to your own bosom?
When you left me to take that voyage, you
promised that nothing should induce you to be
more than civil to any woman, however young
and attractive, with whom Fate might bring you
in contact. I want you to tell me, Peter, whether,
when you were returning home on board the
<i>Boomerang</i>, you kept that promise or not?"</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, she put her question in a
form which made it easy to give a satisfactory and
a truthful answer.</p>

<p>"When I was returning home on board the
<i>Boomerang</i>," he said, "I did not, to the best of my
recollection and belief, exchange two words with
any female whatever, attractive or otherwise&mdash;until,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
he added, with a timely recollection that
she had come on board at Gibraltar,&mdash;"until I met
you. You pain me with these suspicions, Sophia&mdash;you
do, indeed!"</p>

<p>"I believe you, Peter," she said, moved by his
sincerity, which, paradoxical as it may sound, was
quite real; for his intentions had been so excellent
throughout, that he felt injured by her doubts.
"You have never told me a falsehood yet; but for
some time I have been tormented by a fancy that
you were concealing something from me. I can
hardly say what gave me such an impression,&mdash;a
glance, a tone, trifles which, I am glad to think
now, had not the importance I invested them
with. Ah, Peter, never treat me as Helmer did
Nora! Never shut me out from the serious side of
your life, and think to make amends by calling
me your 'little lark,' or your 'squirrel;' you must
not look upon me as a mere doll!"</p>

<p>"My <i>dear</i> Sophia!" he exclaimed, "I should
never think of addressing you as either a squirrel
or a lark; and anyone less like a doll in every
respect, I never met!"</p>

<p>"I hope you will always think so, Peter," she
said; "for I tell you frankly, that if I once discovered
that you had ceased to trust me, that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
lived in a world apart into which I was not
admitted, that very moment, Peter, I should act
just as Nora did&mdash;I should leave you; for our
marriage would have ceased to be one in any true
sense of the word!"</p>

<p>The mere idea of being abandoned by Sophia
made him shiver. What a risk he had been
running, after all! Was it worth while to peril his
domestic happiness for the sake of a few more
conversations with two young ladies, whose remarks
were mostly enigmatic, and for whom he
was conscious in his heart of hearts of not caring
two straws?</p>

<p>"Sophia," he said plaintively, "don't talk of
leaving me! What should I do without you?
Who would teach me Astronomy and things? You
know I don't care for anybody but you! Why will
you dwell on such unpleasant subjects?"</p>

<p>"I was wrong, Peter," she confessed,&mdash;"indeed,
I doubt you no longer. It was all my morbid
imagination that led me to do you such injustice.
Forgive me, and let us say no more about it!"</p>

<p>"I do forgive you," was his generous reply to
this appeal, which, coming from Sophia, was a
very handsome apology, "and we <i>will</i> say no more
about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>And, upon the whole, Peter thought he had got
out of a particularly tight place with more credit
than he had any reason to expect&mdash;a conclusion
in which the reader, however much he or she may
disapprove of his conduct on moral grounds, will
probably be inclined to agree with him.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><b>Foil and Counterfoil.</b></p>

<p class="pi p1"><i>The Duties of Authorship.&mdash;Peter's Continued Perversity
and its Unforeseen Results.&mdash;"Alfred."&mdash;The Tragic
Note.&mdash;An Interrupted Crisis.&mdash;A Domestic Surprise.</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">It would be more satisfactory to an author's
feelings, especially when he is aware that he
will be held accountable by an indignant
public for the slightest deviation on his hero's part
from the narrow path of ideal rectitude&mdash;it would
be more satisfactory to be able to record that this
latest warning had a permanent effect upon Peter
Tourmalin's rather shifty disposition.</p>

<p>But an author, even of a modest performance
such as this, cannot but feel himself in a position
of grave responsibility. He must relate such facts
as he has been able to collect, without suppression
on the one side, or distortion on the other. It is
a duty he cannot and dare not evade, under penalty
of forfeiting the confidence of his readers.</p>

<p>Peter Tourmalin <i>did</i> draw more Time Cheques,
he <i>did</i> go back to the <i>Boomerang</i>, and it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
useless to assert the contrary. We may be able
to rehabilitate him to some extent before this
story concludes: at present, we can only follow
his career with pain and disapproval.</p>

<p>Some allowances must be made for the peculiar
nature of the case. To a person of Peter's natural
inclination to the study of psychology, there was
a strong fascination in watching the gradual
unfolding and revelation of two characters so
opposite and so interesting as those of Miss Tyrrell
and Miss Davenport. That was the point of
view he took himself, and it is difficult to say that
such a plea is wholly without plausibility.</p>

<p>Then, too, he was intensely curious to know how
it would all end, and he might ascertain that in
the very next quarter of an hour he drew; there
was absolutely no telling.</p>

<p>As for Sophia's threat, that soon lost all terrors
for him. She would abandon him, no doubt, if
she ever knew; but who was going to tell her, and
how could she possibly discover the truth unaided,
especially now that her awakening suspicions had
been lulled? His secret was perfectly safe, and he
could unravel the tangled thread of the history of
his remaining extra hours on board the <i>Boomerang</i>
without any other hindrance than that of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
scruples&mdash;which practically amounted to no
hindrance at all.</p>

<p>So Peter continued to be the slave of his clock
and his cheque-book, from the counterfoils of
which he was disagreeably surprised to discover
that he had drawn more frequently, and in consequence
had an even smaller balance left to his
credit, than he had supposed.</p>

<p>However, he consoled himself by concluding
that one or two cheques had probably been mislaid,
and were still unpresented, while he was entitled
to some additional time in respect of compound
interest; so that he need not stint himself at
present. Fifteen minutes a week was not an
extravagant allowance; and sooner or later, even
with the utmost economy, a day would come
when his balance would be exhausted, and his
cheques returned from the clock marked "No
effects&mdash;refer to drawer," or some equivalent
intimation.</p>

<p>But that day was still distant, and in the meantime
he went on drawing with a light heart.</p>

<p>It was a Saturday evening, the day on which
Peter generally presented his weekly cheque; but
although it was nearly half-past ten, he had had
no opportunity of doing so as yet. He was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
drawing-room, and Sophia was reading aloud to
him this time, an article on "Bi-metallism" from one
of the reviews; for she had been an ardent Bi-metallist
from early girlhood, and she naturally
wished to win Peter from his Laodicean apathy on
so momentous a subject. He listened with surface
resignation, although inwardly he was in a fever of
impatience to get back upon the <i>Boomerang</i>, where
Miss Davenport had been more interesting than
usual on his last visit. But he could hardly rise
and slip a cheque under the clock before Sophia's
very eyes without inventing some decent pretext
for such an action, and Bi-metallism had reduced
him to a mental condition which was no longer
fertile in expedients.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sophia stopped reading and remarked:</p>

<p>"If I remember right, Professor Dibbs has
stated the argument more correctly in his little
book on <i>Currency</i>. It would be interesting to
compare the two; I'll get it."</p>

<p>As Professor Dibbs's work was apparently on a
shelf in the study, Sophia took the lamp into the
further room.</p>

<p>"Now's my time!" thought Peter, as he brought
out the cheque from his waistcoat-pocket. "I
mayn't get such another chance this evening."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Even if Sophia could lay her hand on the volume
at once, he would have had his quarter of an hour
and be comfortably back long before she could
pass the arch which separated the two rooms; for,
as we have seen, this instantaneous action was one
of the chief recommendations of the Time Cheques.</p>

<p>So he cashed his cheque, and was at once
transported to the secluded passage between the
deck-cabins, the identical place where he had first
conversed with Miss Davenport. He was on the
same steamer-chair too, and she was at his side;
the wind carried the faint strains of a set of
"Lancers" to them; from all of which circumstances
he drew the inference that he was going
to be favoured with the sequel to the conversation
that had been so incongruously broken in upon
by Sophia's question respecting the comparative
merits of bottle-jacks in the Tottenham Court
Road warehouse. This was so far satisfactory,
indicating as it did that he was at last, after so
much trying back, to make some real progress.</p>

<p>"What I want to know first," Miss Davenport
was saying, "is, whether you are capable of facing
danger for my sake?"</p>

<p>"I thought," he remonstrated mildly, "that I
had already given proof of that!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"The danger you faced then threatened only me.
But, supposing you had to meet a danger to yourself,
could you be firm and cool? Much will depend
on that."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think," he answered frankly, "that
perhaps you had better not count upon me. I
have never been a man to court danger: it might
find me equal to it if it came,&mdash;or it might not."</p>

<p>He did not mean to give it the opportunity.</p>

<p>"Then we are lost, that is all!" she said, with
gloomy conviction. "Lost, both of us!"</p>

<p>Peter certainly intended to be lost if the moment
of trial ever arrived. Even now he was resolving,
for about the twentieth time, that this positively
should be his very last cheque; for he by no means
liked the manner in which the situation seemed to
be developing.</p>

<p>But, seeing that the danger, whatever it might
be, was still far enough off, he thought, very
sensibly, that it would be a pity to cloud this
last interview by any confession of pusillanimity.
Knowing that he would return no more, he could
surely afford to treat with contempt any consequences
his imprudence might have entailed.</p>

<p>So he laughed, as he said:</p>

<p>"You mustn't conclude that I am a coward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
because I don't care to boast. On the contrary,
I believe I am not exactly deficient in physical
courage."</p>

<p>"You are not?" she cried, relieved. "Then&mdash;then
you would not be afraid to face a desperate
man?"</p>

<p>"Not a dozen desperate men, if it comes to
that!" said Peter, supported by the certainty
that it would not come to so much as half a
desperate man.</p>

<p>"Then I can tell you <i>now</i> what I have scarcely
dared to think of before. Peter, you will have to
reckon with Alfred!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not much alarmed at anything
<i>Alfred</i> may do!" said Peter, wondering who the
deuce Alfred was.</p>

<p>"He will come on board; he will demand an
explanation; he will insist on seeing you!" she
cried.</p>

<p>"<i>Let</i> him!" said Peter.</p>

<p>"You are brave&mdash;braver even than I thought;
but, ah! Peter, you don't know what Alfred is!"</p>

<p>Peter did not even know who Alfred was, but he
was unmoved.</p>

<p>"You leave Alfred to me," he said confidently,
"I'll settle <i>him</i>!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I must tell you all. I&mdash;I led you to
believe that Alfred would raise no objections; that
he would quietly accept facts which it is useless
to contend against. He will do nothing of the
sort! He is a man of violent passions&mdash;fierce
and relentless when wronged. In the first burst of
fury at meeting you, when he comes on board, he is
capable of some terrible vengeance, which nothing
but perfect coolness on your part&mdash;perhaps not
even that&mdash;will be able to avert. And I&mdash;I have
brought this upon you!"</p>

<p>"Don't cry," said Peter. "You see, I'm perfectly
calm. <i>I</i> don't mind it. If Alfred considers
himself wronged by me&mdash;though, what I have ever
done to give him any reason for revenging himself
by personal violence, I must say I can't
conceive&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped him.</p>

<p>"Ah! you have given him cause enough!" she
cried. "What is the use of taking that tone to
me?"</p>

<p>"I want to see Alfred's point of view, that's
all," said Peter. "What does he complain
of?"</p>

<p>"<i>What does he complain of?</i> You ask me that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>when&mdash;&mdash; Peter," she broke off suddenly, "there
is somebody round the corner listening to us&mdash;a
woman, I'm sure of it. I heard the rustle of a
dress.... Go and see if there is not!"</p>

<p>Go and see, and find himself face to face with
Miss Tyrrell, who might faint or go into hysterics:
Peter knew better than that.</p>

<p>"It's merely your fancy," he said, soothingly,
"Who can be there? They are all at the other
end of the ship, dancing. Go on telling me about
Alfred. I don't yet understand how I have
managed to offend him."</p>

<p>"Are you really so dull," she said, with a slight
touch of temper, "that you can't see that a man
who thought he was going to meet the woman he
was engaged to, and finds she has learnt to care
for&mdash;for somebody else, is likely, even if he was
the mildest man in the world&mdash;which Alfred is far
from being&mdash;to betray some annoyance?"</p>

<p>"No, I see that," said Peter; "but&mdash;but he
can't blame me. <i>I</i> couldn't help it!"</p>

<p>He said this, although her last speech had
opened his eyes considerably: he knew now who
Alfred was, and also that, in some moment of
madness which was in one of the quarters of an
hour he had not yet drawn, he must have placed
himself in the position of Alfred's rival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>What was he to do? He could not, without
brutality, tell this poor girl that he had not the
smallest intention of depriving Alfred of her affections;
it was better, and easier too, to humour
her for the short time that remained.</p>

<p>"Alfred will not take that as an excuse," she
said. "It is true we could neither of us help what
has happened, but that will not alter the fact that
he is quite capable of shooting us both the instant
he comes on deck. Alfred is like that!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Peter, unable to abstain from a
little more of such very cheap heroism, "I do not
fear death&mdash;with you!"</p>

<p>"Say that once more," she said; which Peter
very obligingly did. "Oh, Peter, how I admire
you now! How little I knew you were capable of
going so calmly to your doom! You give me
courage. I feel that I, too, can face death; only
not <i>that</i> death&mdash;it is so horrid to be shot!"</p>

<p>"It would be unpleasant," said Peter, placidly,
"but soon over."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I couldn't bear it. I can see
him pointing his revolver&mdash;for he always carries
one, even at a picnic&mdash;first at <i>your</i> head, then mine!
No, Peter; since we must die, I prefer at least to
do so without bloodshed!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"So do I," he agreed, "very much."</p>

<p>"You do?" she cried. "Then, oh, Peter! why
should we wait any longer for a fate that is inevitable?
Let us do it now, together!"</p>

<p>"Do <i>what</i>?" said Peter.</p>

<p>"Slip over the side together; it would be quite
easy, no one will see us. Let us plunge arm-in-arm
into the merciful sea! A little struggle&mdash;a
moment's battle for breath&mdash;then all will be over!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it <i>would</i> be over then;" he said;
"but we should have to swallow such a lot of salt
water first!"</p>

<p>He reflected that, even if he emerged from the
agonies of drowning, to find himself Bi-metallising
with Sophia, the experience would be none the
less unpleasant while it lasted. There really must
be some limit to his complaisance, and he set it
at suicide.</p>

<p>"No," he said at last; "I have always held
that to escape a difficulty by putting an end to
one's own life is a cowardly proceeding."</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> a coward," she said; "but, oh, Peter, be a
coward with me for once!"</p>

<p>"Ask me anything else!" he said, firmly, "but
not to stoop to cowardice. There is really no necessity
for it, you see," he added, feeling that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
better speak out plainly. "I have no doubt that
Alfred will listen to reason; and when he is told
that, although, as is excusable enough with two
natures that have much in common, we&mdash;we have
found a mutual pleasure in each other's society&mdash;there
has been nothing on either side inconsistent
with the&mdash;the most ordinary friendship; when he
hears that.... Where are you going?" for
she was rising from her chair.</p>

<p>"Where am I going?" she replied, with an unsteady
laugh. "Why, overboard, if you care to
know!"</p>

<p>"But you mustn't!" he cried, scarcely knowing
what he said. "The&mdash;the captain wouldn't like it.
There's a penalty, I'm sure, for leaving the ship
while it's in motion&mdash;I've seen it on a notice!"</p>

<p>"There is a penalty for having believed in
you," she replied bitterly, "and I am going to
pay it!"</p>

<p>She broke away and rushed out upon the deck
into the starlight, with Peter in pursuit. Here
was a nice result of his philandering, he thought
bitterly. And yet, what had he done? How
could he help the consequences of follies committed
in time he had not even spent yet?
However, what he had to do now was to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Miss Davenport from leaping overboard at any
cost. He would even promise to jump over with
her, if that would soothe her, and of course he
could appoint some time next day&mdash;say, after
breakfast,&mdash;for the performance.</p>

<p>He ran down the shadowy deck until he overtook
a flying female form, whose hand he seized
as she crouched against the bulwarks.</p>

<p>"Miss Davenport, if you will only just ..."
he began, when, without warning, he found himself
back upon his own hearth-rug, holding Sophia
firmly by the wrist!</p>

<p>He felt confused, as well he might, but he tried
to pass it off.</p>

<p>"Did you find Dibbs <i>On Currency</i>, my dear?"
he inquired, with a ghastly smile, as he dropped
her hand.</p>

<p>"I did not," said Sophia, gravely; "I was
otherwise engaged. Peter, what have you been
doing?"</p>

<p>"What have I been doing?" he said. "Why,
it's not a minute since you went into the study
to get that book; look at the clock and see!"</p>

<p>"Don't appeal to the clock, Peter,&mdash;answer my
question. How have you been occupied?"</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for you to finish that article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
on Bi-metallism," he had the hardihood to say.
"Deuced well-written article it is, too; so clear!"</p>

<p>"I don't refer to what you were doing here,"
said Sophia. "What were you doing on board
the <i>Boomerang</i>?"</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it's so long ago that I really forget," he
said. "I&mdash;I read Buckle on deck, and I talked
with a man named Perkins&mdash;nice fellow he was&mdash;manager
of a bank out in Australia."</p>

<p>"It's useless to prevaricate, Peter!" she said.
"What I want to know is, who was that girl, and
why should she attempt to destroy herself?"</p>

<p>He could hardly believe his ears.</p>

<p>"Girl!" he stammered. "How do you know
that any girl attempted anything of that sort?"</p>

<p>"How do I know, Peter?" said Sophia. "I will
tell you how I know. <i>I was on board the 'Boomerang,'
too!</i>"</p>

<p>At this awful piece of intelligence, Peter dropped
into his arm-chair, speechless and quaking. What
would come next he could not tell; but anything
seemed possible, and even probable, after that!</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><b>The Culminating Cheque.</b></p>

<p class="pi p1"><i>Sophia Gives an Explanation, and Requests One.&mdash;Her
Verdict.&mdash;Peter Overruled.</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">"Before I say anything else," said Sophia,
who was still standing upon the hearth-rug,
gazing down upon the wretched Peter
as he sat huddled up in his chair, "you would
probably like to know how I came to follow you
to that steamer. It is a long story, but I will tell
you if you wish to hear?"</p>

<p>Peter's lips moved without producing any
articulate sounds, and Sophia proceeded:</p>

<p>"Some weeks ago," she said, "one afternoon
when you had gone out for a walk, I found what
seemed to be a loose cheque on the carpet. I
knew how carelessly you leave things about, and
I picked it up, and found that, though it was like
a cheque in other respects, it was rather curiously
worded. I could not understand it at all, but it
seemed to have something to do with the steamer
you came home from Australia in; so, intending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to ask you for an explanation when you came in,
I thought in the meantime I would put it in
some safe place where I should be sure to see
it, and I put it behind the clock; and then&mdash;oh,
Peter!&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peter understood. The cheques were all payable
to "self or bearer." Sophia had innocently
presented one, and it had been paid. If he had
only taken "order" cheques, this would not have
happened, but it was too late now! He continued
to imitate the tactics of that eminent strategist,
Brer Rabbit; in other words, he "lay low and
said nuffin," while Sophia continued:</p>

<p>"Then, without in the least knowing how I
came there, I found I was on a big steamer, and
as I walked along, perfectly bewildered, I saw the
name <i>Boomerang</i> painted on some fire-buckets, and
of course I knew then that that was your steamer.
I fancied that perhaps, in some way, you might
be on board too, and would explain how this had
happened to me. At all events, I decided to find
out if you were; and seeing a girl reading on
deck, I took a chair near her, and after a few
introductory remarks I mentioned your name.
The effect upon her was such as to convince me
that she felt more than an ordinary interest in you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
By degrees I drew from her the whole story of her
relations with you: she even asked me&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;for
advice!"</p>

<p>So Miss Davenport's <i>confidante</i> had not been
Miss Tyrrell after all&mdash;but Sophia! If he had
only known that before!</p>

<p>"I could not speak to her," continued Sophia,
"I felt stifled, stupefied by what I had heard! I
could bear no more; and so I rose and left her,
and walked down some stairs, and somehow found
myself back in our own room again! I was more
bewildered than ever. I looked for the cheque,
but there was nothing, and soon I was forced to
believe that the whole thing was imaginary. Still,
I was not wholly satisfied. You may remember
how I questioned you one evening when you were
reading the <i>Doll's House</i> to me; well, your answers
quite reassured me for the time. I told myself
that my suspicions were too wildly improbable not
to have been a delusion. I was even afraid that
my brain must be slightly affected, for I had
always prided myself upon having my imagination
under thorough control. But by degrees, Peter&mdash;by
degrees&mdash;I began to doubt again whether
it was really nothing but fancy on my part. I
noticed that your manner was suspiciously odd at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
times. I discovered that there was one drawer in
your secretary that you kept carefully locked. I
caught your eye wandering towards the clock from
time to time. <i>What</i> I suspected I hardly know;
but I felt certain that I should find the explanation
of that mystery in the locked drawer. I tried key
after key, until I found one that fitted. Oh, I am
not at all ashamed of it! Had I not a <i>right</i> to
know? There were no letters, nothing but a
cheque-book; but that cheque-book proved to me
that, after all, I had imagined nothing: all the
cheques were the same as the one I found on the
carpet! I tore one out and kept it by me, and
from that time I watched you closely. I saw how
restless and impatient you were this evening, and
I was certain that you were intending to use a
cheque from that book. You were bent on getting
back to the <i>Boomerang</i>, and I was equally determined
that, if I could help it, you should not go
alone. Only I could not be quite sure how you
managed to get there, and at last I hit upon a little
device for finding out. There is no such person
as Professor Dibbs, Peter; I invented him to put
you off your guard. As I passed into the other
room with the lamp, I saw you, reflected in the
mirror over the study chimneypiece, rise and go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to the drawing-room mantelpiece: you had a slip
of paper in your hand&mdash;a cheque, of course.
I had the cheque I tore out hidden in the waistband
of my dress; and so, as soon as I saw you
slip your cheque behind the clock in the drawing-room,
I put <i>my</i> cheque behind the one in the
study. I was on the deck at once, and it was
dark, but I could hear your voice and another's&mdash;round
a corner. I held my breath and listened.
What I heard, you know!"</p>

<p>Peter shrank up in his chair, utterly confounded
by this last vagary on the part of the Time
Cheques. He certainly would not have supposed
that the mere presentation even of a "bearer"
cheque by Sophia would entitle her to the same
fifteen minutes he was receiving himself. He could
only account for it by the fact that the two cheques
were cashed simultaneously at two separate clocks;
but even this explanation was not wholly satisfactory.</p>

<p>He found his voice at last:</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "now that you know all, what
are you going to do about it, Sophia? I&mdash;I would
rather know the worst!"</p>

<p>"I will tell you that in good time," she
replied; "but, first of all, I want you to tell me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
exactly how you came to have these cheques,
and what use you made of them on previous
occasions?"</p>

<p>So, slightly reassured by her manner, which was
composed, Peter gave her a plain unvarnished
account of the way in which he had been led to
deposit his extra time, and the whole story of his
interviews with Miss Davenport. He did not
mention any others, because he felt that the affair
was quite complicated enough without dragging in
extraneous and irrelevant matter.</p>

<p>"I may have been imprudent," he concluded;
"but I do assure you, Sophia, that in all the
quarters of an hour I have had as yet, I never once
behaved to that young lady in any capacity but
that of a friend. I only went on drawing the
cheques because I wanted a little change of air
and scene now and then. You have no idea how
it picked me up!"</p>

<p>"I saw in what society it set you down, Peter!"
was Sophia's chilling answer.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you mustn't think she is <i>always</i> like that,"
he urged. "It took me quite by surprise&mdash;it was a
most painful position for me. I think, Sophia,
your own sense of fairness will acknowledge that,
considering the awkwardness of my situation, I&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
behaved as well as could be expected. You do
admit that, don't you?"</p>

<p>Sophia was silent for a minute or so before she
spoke again.</p>

<p>"I must have time to think, Peter," she said:
"it is all so strange, so contrary to all my experience,
that I can hardly see things as yet in their
proper light. But I may tell you at once that,
from what I was able to observe, and from all you
have just told me, I am inclined to think that you
are free from actual culpability in the matter. It
was quite clear that that very forward girl was
the principal throughout, and that you were nothing
more than an unwilling and most embarrassed
accessory."</p>

<p>This was so much more lenient a view than he
had dared to expect that Peter recovered his
ordinary equanimity.</p>

<p>"That was all," he said. "I am very glad you
saw it, my dear. I was perfectly helpless!"</p>

<p>"And then," said Sophia, "I was more than
pleased by your firm refusal to commit suicide.
What you said was so very sound and true,
Peter."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Peter, with much complacency.
"Yes, I was pretty firm with her! By the way,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
he added, "you&mdash;you didn't happen to see whether
she really did jump overboard, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I came away just at the crisis," she said. "I
thought you would tell <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> came away too," said Peter. "It doesn't
matter, of course; but still I should have rather
liked to know whether she meant it or not."</p>

<p>"How can you speak of it so heartlessly, Peter?
She may have been trying to frighten you; she is
just the kind of girl who would. But she may have
been in earnest, after all!"</p>

<p>"You see, Sophia," said Peter, "it doesn't matter
whether she was or not&mdash;it isn't as if it had
ever really happened."</p>

<p>"Not really happened? But I was <i>there</i>; I heard,
I saw it&mdash;nothing could be more real!"</p>

<p>"At any rate," he said, "it only happens when
I use those cheques; and she can't possibly carry
out her rash intention until I draw another&mdash;which
I promise you faithfully I will never do. If you
doubt me, I will burn the book now before your
eyes!"</p>

<p>With these words he went to the drawer and
took out the cheque-book.</p>

<p>"No," said Sophia, "you must not do that,
Peter. There is much about this Time Bank that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
I don't pretend to understand, that I cannot
account for by any known natural law; but I may
not disbelieve my own eyes and ears! These
events that have happened in the extra time you
chose to defer till now are just as real as any
other events. You <i>have</i> made this girl's acquaintance;
you have&mdash;I don't say through any fault of
your own, but still you <i>have</i>&mdash;caused her to transfer
her affections from the man she was engaged
to, and, being a creature of ill-regulated mind and
no strength of character, she has resolved to put
an end to her life rather than meet his just indignation.
She is now on the very point of accomplishing
this folly. Well, badly as she has behaved,
you cannot possibly leave the wretched girl there!
You must go back at once, restrain her by main
force, and not leave her until you have argued her
into a rational frame of mind."</p>

<p>Peter was by no means anxious to go back at
first.</p>

<p>"It's not at all necessary," he said; "and besides,
I don't know if you're aware of it, but with
the way these cheques are worked, it's ten chances
to one against my hitting off the right fifteen minutes!
Still," he added, with an afterthought, "I
can <i>try</i>, of course, if you insist upon it. I can take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
my chance with another fifteen minutes, but that
must be the last. I am sick and tired of this
<i>Boomerang</i> business, I am indeed!"</p>

<p>Shameful as it is to state, he had altered his
mind from a sudden recollection that he would
not mind seeing Miss Tyrrell for just once more.
He had not drawn her for several weeks.</p>

<p>"No," said Sophia, thoughtfully; "I see your
objection&mdash;fifteen minutes is not enough, unless
you could be sure of getting the successors to the
last. But I have an idea, Peter,&mdash;if you draw
out the whole balance of your time, you can't
possibly help getting the right fifteen minutes
somewhere or other. I think that's logical?"</p>

<p>"Oh, devilish logical!" muttered Peter to
himself, who had reasons, which he could not
divulge to her, for strongly disapproving of such
a plan.</p>

<p>"The fact is, my dear," he said, "it&mdash;it's rather
late this evening to go away for any time!"</p>

<p>"You forget," she said, "that, however long you
are away, you will come back at exactly the same
time you started. But you have some other reason,
Peter&mdash;you had better tell me!"</p>

<p>"Well," he owned, "I might come across someone
I'd rather not meet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are thinking of the man that girl said she
had been engaged to&mdash;Alfred, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Peter had forgotten Alfred for the moment; and
besides, he was not likely to turn up till the
<i>Boomerang</i> got to Plymouth, and he knew his extra
hours stopped before that. Still, Alfred did very
well as an excuse.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "Alfred. You heard what she
said about him? A violent character&mdash;with a
revolver, Sophia!"</p>

<p>"But you told her you were not afraid of him. I
felt so proud of you when you said it. And think,
you may be able to bring them together&mdash;to heal
the breach between them!"</p>

<p>"He's more likely to make a breach in me that
won't heal!" said Peter.</p>

<p>"Still, as you said yourself, it isn't as if it was
all actually existing. What does it matter, even if
he should shoot you?"</p>

<p>"I don't see any advantage in exposing myself
to any such unpleasant experiences, even if they
are only temporary," he said.</p>

<p>"It is not a question of advantage, Peter," rejoined
Sophia; "it is a simple duty, and I'm surprised
that you don't see it as such. Whatever
the consequences of your conduct may be, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
cannot evade them like this; you have chosen to
begin, and you must go on! I am quite clear
about that. Let me see"&mdash;(here she took the
cheque-book, and made some rapid calculations
from the counterfoils)&mdash;"yes, you have two hours
and three-quarters at least still standing to your
credit; and then there's the compound interest. I
will tear out all these small cheques and burn
them." Which she did as she spoke. "And now,
Peter, sit down and fill up one of the blank ones at
the end for the whole amount."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Sophia," said Peter, "it occurs
to me that this is just one of those matters which
can only be satisfactorily arranged by&mdash;er&mdash;a
woman's tact. Suppose I make the cheque payable
to <i>you</i> now&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"You mean, that you want me to go instead of
you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well," said Peter, "if it wouldn't be bothering
you, my dear, I think perhaps it <i>would</i> be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say another word," she interrupted, "or
I shall begin to <i>despise</i> you, Peter! If I thought
you meant it seriously, I would go upstairs, put
on my bonnet, and go back to mamma for ever. I
could not bear to be the wife of a coward!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll go!" said Peter, in much alarm. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
said what I did out of consideration, not cowardice.
But wouldn't to-morrow do as well, Sophia? It is
late to turn out!"</p>

<p>"To-morrow will <i>not</i> do as well," she said: "fill
up that cheque to-night, or you will lose me for
ever!"</p>

<p>"There!" said Peter, as he scrawled off the
cheque. "Are you satisfied <i>now</i>, Sophia?"</p>

<p>"I shall be when I see you present it."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;yes," he said; "oh! I mean to present it&mdash;presently.
I&mdash;I think I'll take a small glass of
brandy before I go, my dear, to keep the cold
out."</p>

<p>"As you will certainly be in a summer, if not
tropical, temperature the next moment," she said,
"I should advise you to take nothing of the
kind."</p>

<p>"I say," he suggested, "suppose I find she has
just jumped overboard&mdash;what shall I do then?"</p>

<p>"Do! Can you possibly ask? You will jump
after her, of course!"</p>

<p>"It's easy to say 'of course,'" he said; "but I
never <i>could</i> swim more than twenty strokes!"</p>

<p>"Swim those twenty then, and let come what
will; you will be back all the sooner. But don't
stand there talking about it, Peter&mdash;go!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going," he said, meekly. "You'll sit up
for me, Sophia, if&mdash;if I'm late, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd!" she said. "You know
perfectly well that, as I said before, you won't be
away a second."</p>

<p>"It won't be a second for you," he said, "but
it will be several hours for <i>me</i>; and goodness only
knows what I may have to go through in the time!
However," he added, with an attempt to be cheerful,
"it may all pass off quite pleasantly&mdash;don't
you think it may, Sophia?"</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> I tell? You will only find out by
going."</p>

<p>"I'm going, my dear&mdash;I'm going at once!...
You'll give me just one kiss before I start, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"I will give you no kiss till you come back and
I hear what you have done," said Sophia.</p>

<p>"Very well," he retorted; "you may be sorry
you refused, when it's too late! I may never come
back at all, for anything I can tell!"</p>

<p class="p2">And, little as he knew it, he spoke with an
almost prophetic anticipation of what was to
come. Never again was he destined to stand on
that heart-hrug!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>But he dared not linger longer, as he could see
from her expression that she would suffer no
further trifling; and he slipped his last cheque
under the clock,&mdash;with consequences that must be
reserved for the next chapter.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><b>Paid in His Own Coin.</b></p>

<p class="pi p1"><i>In Suspense: a Gleam of Comfort.&mdash;Darkness Returns.&mdash;The
Rock Ahead.&mdash;Sir William Lends His
Binocular.&mdash;Reappearance of an Old Enemy.&mdash;A
New Danger.&mdash;Out of the Frying-pan.</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">Peter found himself below this time, in the
broad passage, furnished with seats and
tables for writing, which divided the passengers'
cabins. Above, he heard a confused stir
and bustle of excitement, the trampling of feet,
the creaking and rattle of chains, orders shouted
in English and Hindustani. From the absence of
all vibration, in the vessel, it was evident that she
had been brought to. <i>Why?</i></p>

<p>Peter guessed the cause only too easily: the
unhappy Miss Davenport had indeed succeeded
in carrying out her rash design. She had jumped
overboard, and the captain had stopped the
engines and lowered a boat in the hope of picking
her up before she sank! And he himself&mdash;why
was he skulking below like this? He had only too
much reason to fear that he must have been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
witness of the fatal leap; and, instead of plunging
overboard to the rescue as a hero ought, had
rushed down here ignominiously.</p>

<p>Had he been observed? Was his connection
with the tragedy suspected? Could he venture
up on deck and inform himself? He tried, but
his nerve failed him, and he sank into one of the
chairs in a state of almost unbearable suspense.</p>

<p>Just at this moment, he saw the skirts of a
muslin gown appear at the head of the broad
companion which led to the dining-saloon. Someone,
a girl evidently, was descending. Presently
he saw her fully revealed&mdash;it was Miss Tyrrell.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had never been so glad to see her
before. She was a friend, a dear friend. She, at
least, would sympathise with him, would understand
that it was not his fault if he had been too
late to avert a catastrophe. She was coming to
him. Her eyes were friendly and pitiful as they
sought his. She, at least, did not turn from
him!</p>

<p>"How pale, how terribly pale you look!" she
said. "You must nerve yourself to see her&mdash;it
cannot be long now!"</p>

<p>"Has she been brought on board yet?" he
gasped. "Is&mdash;is there any hope?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall know very soon. It is possible you
may find that all is at an end."</p>

<p>"Ah! you think so? But&mdash;but no one will say
it was <i>my</i> fault, will they? I&mdash;I was ready to
make any sacrifice&mdash;only somehow, when the
moment comes, I am apt to lose my presence of
mind."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," she said feelingly; "you are
not quite yourself yet, but I know you would
make the sacrifice if your duty demanded it. But
she may have taken advantage of your absence to
free herself and you from all obligation, may she
not?"</p>

<p>This suggestion comforted Peter.</p>

<p>"She <i>must</i> have done!" he said. "Yes, of
course. I could not be expected to prevent it, if
I wasn't there; and I wasn't, when it came to
the point. But, Miss Tyrrell, do you think that
it is really all over? She&mdash;she may come round
after all!"</p>

<p>"She may&mdash;but of course, if it is true that she
is engaged to another, she can have no possible
claim on <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>What a sensible right-minded way this girl had
of looking at things! thought Peter, not for the
first time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, of course she can't!" he cried. "And
it <i>is</i> true. She is engaged&mdash;to a fellow of the
name of Alfred."</p>

<p>"You know that as a fact?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I know it from her own lips, and I need not
say that I should be the last person to wish to&mdash;er&mdash;upset
so desirable an arrangement."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;<i>why</i> didn't you tell me all this before?"
she inquired.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't think it would interest you," he
replied.</p>

<p>Here, to Peter's utter astonishment, she covered
her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"Not interest me!" she murmured at last.
"Oh, how could you&mdash;how <i>could</i> you keep this
from me? Can't you see&mdash;can't you guess what
a difference it has made in my feelings?"</p>

<p>It might be very dull of him, but he could <i>not</i>
perceive why the fact of Miss Davenport's engagement
to Alfred should affect Miss Tyrrell so
strangely as this!</p>

<p>"I may call you 'Peter' now," she said. "Oh,
Peter, <i>how</i> happy you have made me! Why
did you keep silence so long? It was too quixotic!
Don't you understand even yet?"</p>

<p>"No," said Peter blankly, "I'm afraid I don't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, if you are really so diffident, I&mdash;I must
tell you that if you were to ask a certain question
once more, I might&mdash;I don't say I should, but I
might&mdash;meet it with a different answer!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he ejaculated, involuntarily.</p>

<p>"But you must not ask me yet&mdash;not just yet.
I must have time to consider. I must tell papa
before I decide anything. You <i>will</i> wait a little
longer, won't you, Peter?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, feeling limp, "I'll wait. I'd
rather!"</p>

<p>She smiled radiantly upon him, and then fled
lightly up the companion, leaving him with fresh
cause for uneasiness. He could no longer doubt
that, for some reason, she expected him to propose
to her, which it seemed he had already, in
one of those confounded extra minutes, been unprincipled
enough to do! Now she had gone to
inform her father, the Judge, and he would have
the disagreeable task of disabusing them before
long!</p>

<p>At this point he started, believing that he was
visited by an apparition; for a cabin-door opened,
and Miss Davenport came out and stood before
him.</p>

<p>But she was so obviously flesh and blood&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
so dry&mdash;that he soon saw that all his anxiety on
her account had been superfluous.</p>

<p>"Then you&mdash;you didn't jump overboard after
all?" he faltered, divided between relief and
annoyance at having been made to come back, as
it were, on false pretences.</p>

<p>"You know who prevented me, and by what
arguments!" she said, in a low strained voice.</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i> I?" he said, helplessly.</p>

<p>"Who should, if you do not? Did not you
implore me not to leave you, and declare that, if I
would only have courage and wait, we should be
happy even yet? And I <i>did</i> wait. For what, I
ask you, Peter Tourmalin&mdash;for <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"It's really no use asking <i>me</i>," he said, "for
I've no idea!"</p>

<p>"I waited&mdash;to discover that all this time you
have had a secret understanding with another;
that you are about to transfer your fickle affections
to&mdash;to that fair girl! Don't deny it, Peter! I was
listening. I see it all&mdash;all!"</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness <i>I</i> did!" he said. "I never
was in such a muddle as this in my life. I can
only assure you that if that young lady really
imagines that I am, or can be, anything more to her
than a friend, she is entirely mistaken. I was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
about to go up and explain as much to her
father!"</p>

<p>"You are not deceiving me?" she asked,
earnestly. "You are <i>sure</i>?"</p>

<p>"I will swear it, if you wish!" he replied.</p>

<p>"No," she said, relenting visibly, "your word
is enough. I do believe you, and I am almost
happy again. So long as you do not desert me,
even Alfred loses half his terrors!"</p>

<p>"Exactly," he said; "and now, if you will excuse
me, I'll just run up on deck and settle this
other business."</p>

<p>He went up to the hurricane-deck, and found
the ship had anchored. In front was a huge
barren rock, with lines of forts, walls, and telegraph
poles; and at its base, a small white
town huddled. They had arrived at Gibraltar,
which accounted for the absence of motion.</p>

<p>As he stood there, taking this in, he was accosted
by Sir William Tyrrell, who thrust his arm through
Peter's in a friendly manner.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said the Judge heartily,
"Violet has just told me the good news. I can
only say that I am delighted&mdash;most delighted!
I have always felt a warm interest in you, ever
since that affair of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of the monkey," said Peter. "I am very
glad to hear it, Sir William; but&mdash;but I ought to
tell you that I am afraid Miss Tyrrell was&mdash;a
little premature. She misinterpreted a remark
of mine, which, in point of fact, referred to somebody
else altogether."</p>

<p>"Then you have no more reason than before
for assuming that your <i>fiançée</i> has thrown you
over. Am I to understand that?"</p>

<p>"No more reason than before," admitted
Peter.</p>

<p>"And your uncertainty still continues? Very
unsatisfactory, I must say! I do think, my dear
fellow, that, in your position, you should have
been more careful to refrain from betraying any
interest in Violet until you knew that you were
free to speak. As it is, you may have cast a
shadow upon her young life that it will take
years to dispel!"</p>

<p>Peter's heart sank into his boots for very shame
at this gentle and almost paternal reproof.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the worthy Judge, "Violet is
a high-minded girl, scrupulously sensitive on points
of honour; and, unless the young lady you are
under a semi-engagement to should release you of
her own free will, I know my daughter too well to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
doubt that she will counsel you to fulfil your contract
and renounce all hope so far as she is
concerned."</p>

<p>Peter felt a little easier.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am prepared to do that," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't say myself that I go quite so far
as she does; but strictly, no doubt, a promise
is a promise, and should be kept at all hazards.
You have done all that a man can honourably
do to put himself right. You have written to
this young lady, so I understand, informing
her of the change in your sentiments, and offering,
nevertheless, to redeem your promise if she
insisted upon it. I think that was the general
purport of your letter?"</p>

<p>Here was one more evil fruit of his extra time!
What would Sophia think, or say, or do, if such
a letter as that ever came to her knowledge?
Fortunately, that at least was impossible!</p>

<p>"You have some grounds," the Judge went on,
"for assuming that the lady has already treated
the contract as non-existent&mdash;a person called
Alfred, I think my daughter said?"</p>

<p>"No, that was a mistake," explained Peter.
"Alfred is engaged to quite a different person."</p>

<p>"Well, in any case, it is quite possible that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
may obtain your release when you meet her; and
your suspense will soon be over now. Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Pincher,
is it?&mdash;will probably be on board the
ship before many minutes. I see the boats are
putting out from the harbour already."</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" cried Peter, with the terrible conviction
darting through his mind that Sir William
spoke the bare truth.</p>

<p>Sophia had said something about meeting him
at Gibraltar; but if she had done so during the
real voyage, how could he have the meeting all
over again, with this ghastly variation? If he
could only remember whether she had come out,
or not! It was singular, incomprehensible! But
his memory was a blank on such a vital fact
as this!</p>

<p>"Would you like to have my field-glass for
a moment?" said Sir William, considerately.</p>

<p>Peter took it, and the next moment the binocular
fell from his nerveless hands. He had seen
only too clearly the familiar form of Sophia seated
in the peaked stern of a small craft, which a
Spanish boatman was "scissoring" through the
waves towards the <i>Boomerang</i>.</p>

<p>"Come, courage!" said the Judge kindly, as
he picked up his glass and wiped the lenses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
"Don't be nervous, my boy. You don't know
what she may have to say to you yet, you know!"</p>

<p>"No, I don't!" he groaned. "I&mdash;I think I
ought to go down to the gangway and meet
her," he added, tremulously,&mdash;not that he had
any intention of doing so, but he wanted to be
alone.</p>

<p>Before the Judge could even express his approbation
of Peter's course, Tourmalin was down
on the saloon-deck seeking a quiet spot wherein
to collect his thoughts.</p>

<p>Before he could find the quiet spot, however,
he almost ran into the arms of the matron from
Melbourne, whom he had not seen since the
episode of the music-room.</p>

<p>"A word with you, Mr. Tourmalin!" she
said.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I really can't stop now," stammered Peter.
"I&mdash;I'm expecting friends!"</p>

<p>"I, too," she said, "am expecting a relation,
and it is for that reason that I wish to speak to
you now. My brother, who has been staying at
Gibraltar on account of his health, will be as
determined as I am to trace and punish the
infamous calumny upon the name and career of
our honoured parent."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"I daresay, madam," said Peter,&mdash;"I daresay.
Very creditable to you both&mdash;but I really can't
stop just now!"</p>

<p>"You appear to forget, sir, that, unless you
can satisfactorily establish your innocence, my
brother will certainly treat you as the person
primarily responsible for an atrocious slander!"</p>

<p>"A slander&mdash;upon your father!... <i>Me?</i>"
said the indignant Peter. "Why, I never <i>heard</i> of
the gentleman!"</p>

<p>"Denial will not serve you now," she said. "I
have not only your own admissions in the music-room,
but the evidence of more than one trustworthy
witness, to prove that you circulated a
report that my dear father&mdash;one of the most
honoured and respected citizens of Melbourne&mdash;began
his Colonial career as&mdash;as a transported
convict!"</p>

<p>After all, as the hapless Peter instantly saw, he
<i>might</i> have said so, for anything he knew, in one
of those still unexhausted extra quarters of an
hour!</p>

<p>"If I said so, I was misinformed," he said.</p>

<p>"Just so; and in our conversation on the subject,
you mentioned the name of the person who
used you as his mouthpiece to disseminate his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
malicious venom. What I wish to know now is,
whether you are prepared or not to repeat that
statement?"</p>

<p>Peter recollected now that he had used expressions
implicating Mr. Perkins, although
merely as the origin of totally different complications.</p>

<p>"I can't positively go so far as that," he said.
"I&mdash;I made the statement generally."</p>

<p>"As you please," she said. "I can merely say
that my brother, whom I expect momentarily,
is, although an invalid in some respects, a powerful
and determined man; and unless you repeat in
his presence the sole excuse you have to offer, he
will certainly horsewhip you in the presence of the
other passengers. That is all, sir!"</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;it's quite enough!" murmured
Peter, thinking that Alfred himself could hardly
be much more formidable; and he slipped down
the companion to the cabin-saloon, where he
found Miss Davenport anxiously expecting him.</p>

<p>"He is here," she whispered. "I have just
seen him through the port-hole."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;the old lady's brother!" he replied.</p>

<p>"He has <i>no</i> sister who is an old lady. I mean
Alfred."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Alfred?</i>" he almost yelped. "Alfred <i>here!</i>"</p>

<p>"Of course he is here. Is not his battalion
quartered at Gibraltar? You knew it; we were
to meet him here!"</p>

<p>"I didn't, indeed&mdash;or I should never have come!"
he protested.</p>

<p>"Don't let us waste words now. He is here; he
will demand an explanation from you. He has
his pistol with him&mdash;I could tell by the bulge
under his coat. We must both face him; and the
question is, What are you going to say?"</p>

<p>Peter thrust his hands through his carefully-parted
hair:</p>

<p>"Say?" he repeated. "I shall tell him the
simple, straightforward truth. I shall frankly admit
that we have walked, and sat, and talked together;
but I shall assure him, as I can honestly, that
during the whole course of our acquaintance I
have never once regarded you in any other light
but that of a friend."</p>

<p>"And you suppose that, knowing how I have
changed, he will believe that!" she cried. "He
will fire long before you can finish one of those
fine sentences!"</p>

<p>"In that case," suggested Peter, "why tell
him anything at all? Why not spare him, poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
fellow, at all events for the time? It will only
upset him just now. Let him suppose that we
are strangers to one another; and you can break
the truth to him gently when you reach England,
you know. I 'm sure that's <i>much</i> the more sensible
plan!"</p>

<p>She broke into strange mirthless laughter.</p>

<p>"Your prudence comes too late," she said.
"You forget that the truth was broken to him
some days ago, in the letter I wrote from
Brindisi."</p>

<p>"You wrote and broke it to him at Brindisi!"
cried Peter. "What induced you to do <i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"Why, <i>you!</i>" she retorted. "You insisted that
it was due to him; and though I knew better than
you what the effect would be, I dared not tell you
the whole truth. I wanted to end the engagement,
too; and I scarcely cared then what consequences
might follow. Now they are upon us, and it is
useless to try to escape them. Since we <i>must</i> die,
let us go up on deck and get it over!"</p>

<p>"One moment," he said; "Alfred can wait a
little. I&mdash;I must go to my cabin first, and put on
a clean collar."</p>

<p>And with this rather flimsy pretext, he again
made his escape. He made up his mind what to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
do as he rushed towards his cabin. He could hardly
have been anything like an hour on board the
<i>Boomerang</i> as yet; he had to get through at least
another three before he could hope for deliverance.
His only chance was to barricade himself
inside his cabin, and steadfastly refuse to come
out, upon any consideration whatever, until he was
released by the natural expiration of time.</p>

<p>He sped down the passage, and found, to his
horror, that he had forgotten the number of his
berth. However, he knew where it ought to be,
and darted into an open door, which he fastened
securely with hook and bolt, and sank breathless
on one of the lower berths.</p>

<p>"You seem in a hurry, my friend!" said a
voice opposite; and Peter's eyes, unused at first
to the comparative dimness, perceived that a big
man was sitting on the opposite berth, engaged in
putting on a pair of spiked cricket-shoes. He had
bolted himself inside the cabin with Mr. Perkins!</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><b>Compound Interest.</b></p>

<p class="pi p1"><i>Back to the Fire Again.&mdash;A Magnanimous Return.&mdash;Catching
at Straws.&mdash;Two Total Strangers.&mdash;Purely
a Question of Precedence.&mdash;"Hemmed in" and
"Surrounded."&mdash;The Last Chance.</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">The Bank Manager looked across at Peter
with an amused smile; he seemed quite
friendly. Whether he was in Peter's
cabin, or Peter in his, did not appear; and perhaps
it was not of much consequence either way.
If the cabin belonged to Mr. Perkins, he did not,
at all events, appear to resent the intrusion.</p>

<p>"You seem rather put out about something," he
said again, as Peter was still too short of breath
for words.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," panted Peter, "it's nothing. There
was so much bustle going on above, that I
thought I'd come in here for a little quiet; that's
all."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Manager, "I'm glad you
looked in; for, as it happens, you're the very man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
I wanted to see. I daresay you're wondering why
I'm putting on these things?"</p>

<p>Peter nodded his head, which was all he felt
equal to.</p>

<p>"Why, I've just been having a talk with that
old she-griffin from Melbourne. Perhaps you
don't know that her brother is coming on board
directly?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I <i>do!</i>" said Peter.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems she means to denounce me to
him as the slanderer of her father. She may, if
she chooses; my conscience is perfectly clear on
that score. No one can bring anything of the
sort home to me; and I've no doubt I shall soon
satisfy him that I'm as innocent as an unborn
babe. Still, I want you, as a respectable man
and the only real friend I have on board, to come
with me and be my witness that you never heard
such a rumour from my lips; and besides, sir, we
shall have an opportunity at last of seeing the
unutterable scamp who has had the barefaced
impudence to say I told him this precious story!
She's going to produce him, sir; and if he dares
to stand me out to my face&mdash;well, <i>he</i>'ll know why
I've put on these shoes! Come along; I can't let
you off."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter dared not refuse, for fear of attracting his
friend's suspicions. He could only trust to slipping
away in the confusion; and so, unfastening the
cabin-door, the Manager caught the unresisting
Tourmalin tightly by the arm, and hurried him
along the central passage and up the companion.</p>

<p>Even Miss Davenport would have been a welcome
diversion at that moment; but she was not
there to intercept him, and he reached the upper
deck more dead than alive.</p>

<p>"Where's that old vixen <i>now?</i>" exclaimed the
Manager, dropping Peter's arm. "Here, just stay
where you are a minute, till I find her and her
confounded brother!"</p>

<p>He bustled off, leaving Tourmalin by the davits,
quite incapable of action of any kind in the
presence of this new and awful dilemma. He had
been spreading a cruel and unjustifiable slander
against an irreproachable Colonial magnate, whose
son was now at hand to demand reparation with a
horsewhip. He could only propitiate him by
denouncing Perkins as his informant, and if he
did that he would be kicked from one end of the
ship to the other with a spiked boot! This was
Nemesis indeed, and it was Sophia who had insisted
upon his exposing himself to it. What a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
fool he was not to fly back to that cabin, while he
could!</p>

<p>He turned to flee, and as he did so a hand was
passed softly through his arm.</p>

<p>"Not <i>that</i> way, Peter!" said Miss Tyrrell's voice.</p>

<p>A wild, faint hope came to him that he might
be going to receive one of the back quarters of an
hour. The caprices of the Time Cheques were
such that it was quite possible he would be thrown
back into an earlier interview. Little as he felt
inclined for any social intercourse just then, he
saw that it would afford him a brief interlude&mdash;would
at least give him breathing-time before his
troubles began again.</p>

<p>"I will go wherever you choose," he said; "I
am in your hands."</p>

<p>"I came," she said, "to take you to her. She
is asking for you."</p>

<p>"She?" said Peter. "For heaven's sake, <i>who?</i>"</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Pinceney, of course. I knew who
it was directly I saw her face. Peter, is it true,
as papa tells me, that I misunderstood you just
now&mdash;that she is <i>not</i> engaged to Alfred?"</p>

<p>"Alfred? No!" he replied. "If she is engaged
to anyone at all, I have strong grounds
for supposing it's to me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we must submit, that is all," said Miss
Tyrrell. "But we do not know her decision yet;
there is still hope!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "there is hope still. Let us
go to her; make haste!"</p>

<p>He meant what he said. Sophia could at least
extricate him from a portion of his difficulties.
Miss Tyrrell&mdash;magnanimous and unselfish girl that
she was, in spite of her talent for misapprehension&mdash;was
ready to resign him to a prior claim, if one
was made. And Sophia was bound to claim him;
for if the engagement between them had been
broken off, he could not now be her husband, as
he was. Even Time Cheques must recognise
accomplished facts.</p>

<p>He followed her across the ship, turning down
the very passage in which he had sat through
more than one cheque with Miss Davenport; and
on the opposite side he found Sophia standing,
with her usual composure, waiting for his arrival.</p>

<p>She was so identically the same Sophia that he
had left so lately, that he felt reassured. She, at
least, could not be the dupe of all this. She had
come&mdash;how, he did not trouble himself to think,&mdash;but
she had come with the benevolent intention of
saving him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you do, my love?" he began. "I&mdash;I
thought I should see you here."</p>

<p>"You only see me here, Peter," she replied, in
a voice that trembled slightly, in spite of her
efforts to command it, "because I felt very strongly
that it was my duty to put an end at the earliest
moment to a situation which has become impossible!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure," said Peter, "it is quite time it
<i>was</i> put an end to&mdash;it couldn't go on like this much
longer."</p>

<p>"It shall not, if I can help it," she said. "Miss
Tyrrell, pray don't go away; what I have to say
concerns you too."</p>

<p>"No; don't go away, Miss Tyrrell," added
Peter, who felt the most perfect confidence in
Sophia's superior wisdom, and was now persuaded
that somehow it was all going to be explained.
"Sir William, will you kindly step this way too?
Sir William Tyrrell&mdash;Miss Pinceney. Miss
Pinceney has something to tell you which will
make my position thoroughly clear."</p>

<p>"I have only to say," she said, "that your
honourable and straightforward conduct, Peter,
has touched me to the very heart. I feel that I
am the only person to blame, for it was I who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
insisted upon your subjecting yourself to this
test."</p>

<p>"It was," said Peter. "I told you something
would happen&mdash;and it has!"</p>

<p>"I would never hold you to a union from which
all love on your side had fled; do not think so,
Peter. And now that I see my&mdash;my rival, I confess
that I could expect no other result. So, dear
Miss Tyrrell, I resign him to you freely&mdash;yes,
cheerfully&mdash;for, by your womanly self-abnegation
you have proved yourself the worthier. Take her,
Peter; you have my full consent!"</p>

<p>"My dear young lady," said the Judge, deeply
affected, "this is most noble of you! Allow me
to shake you by the hand."</p>

<p>"I can't thank you, dear, <i>dear</i> Miss Pinceney!"
sobbed his daughter. "Peter, tell her for me how we
shall both bless and love her all our lives for this!"</p>

<p>Peter's brain reeled. Was <i>this</i> Sophia's notion
of getting him out of a difficulty?</p>

<p>As he gazed distractedly around, his eyes became
fixed and glazed with a new terror. A stalwart
stranger, with a bushy red beard, was coming
towards him, with a stout riding-whip in his right
hand. By his side walked the Manager, from whose
face all vestige of friendliness had vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"As soon as you have quite finished your conversation
with these ladies," said the Manager,
with iron politeness, "this gentleman would be
glad of a few moments with you; after which I
shall request your attention to a little personal
affair of my own. Don't let us <i>hurry</i> you, you
know!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I won't," returned Peter, flurriedly; "but
I'm rather busy just now: a little later, I&mdash;I shall
be delighted."</p>

<p>As he stood there, he was aware that they had
withdrawn to a bench some distance away, where
they conferred with the elderly lady from Melbourne.
He could feel their angry glare upon him, and it
contributed to rob him of the little self-possession
he had left.</p>

<p>"Sophia," he faltered piteously, "I say, this is
too bad&mdash;it is, really! You <i>can't</i> mean to leave
me in such a hole as this&mdash;do let's get home at
once!"</p>

<p>Before she could make any reply to an appeal
which seemed to astonish her considerably, a thin,
bilious-looking man, with a face twitching with
nervous excitement, a heavy black moustache, and
haggard eyes, in which a red fire smouldered,
appeared at the gangway and joined the group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, lifting his hat;
"forgive me if I interrupt you, but my business is
urgent&mdash;most urgent! Perhaps you could kindly
inform me if there is a&mdash;a gentleman" (the word cost
him a manifest struggle to pronounce)&mdash;"a gentleman
on board of the name of Tourmalin? I have a
little matter of business" (here his right hand stole
to his breast-pocket) "to transact with him," he
explained, with a sinister smile that caused Peter
to give suddenly at the knees.</p>

<p>"It's that infernal Alfred!" he thought. "Now I
<i>am</i> done for!"</p>

<p>"Why," said Miss Tyrrell, who was clinging
affectionately to Peter's arm, "<i>this</i> is Mr. Tourmalin!
You can speak to him now&mdash;here, if you
choose. We have no secrets from one another&mdash;have
we, Peter?"</p>

<p>"I have lately learnt," said the gloomy man,
"that a certain Mr. Tourmalin has stolen from me
the affection of one who was all heaven and earth
to me!"</p>

<p>"Then it <i>must</i> be another Mr. Tourmalin," said
Miss Tyrrell, "not this one; because&mdash;surely you
do not need to be told that you have no rivalry to
fear from him?" she broke off, with a blush of
charming embarrassment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Alfred's scowl distinctly relaxed, and Peter felt
that, after all, this unfortunate misunderstanding
on Miss Tyrrell's part might prove serviceable to
him. Since Sophia, for reasons of her own, refused
to assist him, he must accept any other help that
offered itself.</p>

<p>"The best proof I can give you of my innocence,"
he said, "is to mention that I have the
honour to be engaged to this lady."</p>

<p>He heard a stifled shriek from behind him as he
made this assertion, and the next moment Miss
Davenport, who must have come up in time to
catch the last words, had burst into the centre of
the group.</p>

<p>"It is not true!" she cried. "Alfred, you must
not believe him!"</p>

<p>"Not <i>true?</i>" exclaimed Alfred, Sophia, Miss
Tyrrell, and Sir William, in the same breath.</p>

<p>"No!" said Miss Davenport; "at least, if he
has really engaged himself, it is within the last
few minutes, and with the chivalrous intention of
shielding <i>me!</i> Peter, I will not be shielded by such
means. Our love is too precious to be publicly
denied. I cannot suffer it; I will acknowledge it,
though it costs me my life! You," she added,
turning to Sophia,&mdash;"you can prove that I speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the truth. It was to you that I confided, that
day we met on deck, the story of our fatal
attachment."</p>

<p>"I really think you must be mistaken," said
Sophia, coldly. "If you confided such a story
to anybody, it could not have been to me; for,
until a few minutes ago, I had never set foot upon
this ship."</p>

<p>How Sophia could stand there and, remembering,
as she must do, her recent appropriation of
the Time Cheque, tell such a downright fib as
this, passed Peter's comprehension. But, as her
statement was in his favour so far as it went, he
knew better than to contradict it.</p>

<p>"Whether it was you or not," insisted Miss
Davenport, "it is he and no one else who rendered
my engagement to Alfred utterly repugnant to me!
Can you look at him now, and doubt me longer?"</p>

<p>"So, Peter," said Sophia severely, "you could
not even be faithful to your unfaithfulness!"</p>

<p>Miss Tyrrell made no comment, but she dropped
his arm as if it had scorched her fingers, whereupon
Miss Davenport clung to it in her stead,
to Peter's infinite dismay and confusion.</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> faithful!" she cried. "It is only a
mistaken sense of honour that made him apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
false. Yes, Alfred, what I wrote to you,
and the postscript he added, is the simple truth.
We cannot command our own hearts. Such love
as I once had for you is dead&mdash;it died on the fatal
day which brought him across my path. We
met&mdash;we love; deal with us as you will! I would
rather, ever so much rather, die with him than
lose him now!"</p>

<p>Alfred was already beginning to fumble fiercely
in his breast-pocket. Peter felt the time had
arrived for plain speaking; he could not submit
to be butchered under a ridiculous misapprehension
of this kind.</p>

<p>"Listen to me!" he said eagerly, "before you
do anything rash, or you may bitterly regret it
afterwards. I do assure you that I am the victim&mdash;we
are <i>all</i> the victims of a series of unfortunate
cheques&mdash;I should say, mistakes. It's absurd
to make me responsible for the irregular proceedings
of a nonsensical Bank. If I had spent my
time as I ought to have done <i>at</i> the time, instead
of putting it out on deposit, I should never
have dreamed of employing it in any kind of
philandering!"</p>

<p>"That," said Sophia, "is undeniable: but you
spent it as you ought <i>not</i> to have done!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Such a speech comes ill from you," he said,
reproachfully, "after having expressly condoned
the past; and, however I may have appeared to philander,
I can conscientiously declare that my sentiments
towards both of these young ladies&mdash;<i>both</i>, you
understand&mdash;have been restricted to a respectful
and&mdash;and merely friendly esteem.... Don't
shoot, Alfred!... I thought that was quite
understood on all sides. Only have a little more
patience, Alfred, and I will undertake to convince
even you that I could not for a moment have contemplated
depriving you of the hand of this
extremely charming and attractive lady, who will
<i>not</i> let go my arm.... I&mdash;I am a married
man!"</p>

<p>"Married!" shrieked Miss Davenport, cowering
back.</p>

<p>"Married!" exclaimed Miss Tyrrell, as she hid
her face upon her father's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Married!" shouted the Judge. "By heavens,
sir, you shall account to me for this!"</p>

<p>"Married!" cried Sophia. "Oh, Peter, I was
<i>not</i> prepared for this! When? Where?"</p>

<p>"<i>When? Where?</i>" he echoed. "You were not
prepared for it? Perhaps you will ask me next
who my wife is!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall not indeed," said Sophia, "for I
have no longer the slightest curiosity on such a
subject!"</p>

<p>Peter collapsed upon the nearest bench.</p>

<p>"Sophia?" he cried hoarsely, "why keep this up
any longer? Surely it is gone far enough&mdash;you
<i>can't</i> pretend you don't know!"</p>

<p>But while he spoke the words, he saw suddenly
that his attempt to force her hand was hopeless:
she was quite sincere in her surprise; she was the
Sophia of <i>six months ago</i>, and no amount of
explanation could ever make her comprehend
what had happened since that time!</p>

<p>And here Alfred broke his silence.</p>

<p>"What you have just confessed," he said,
"removes my last scruple. I might, for all I can
tell, have stayed my hand and spared your life
upon your promise to make Maud happy; for,
in spite of her treatment of me, her happiness is
still my first consideration. But now you have
declared that impossible,&mdash;why, as soon as I can
get this revolver out of my pocket&mdash;for it has
stuck in the confounded lining&mdash;I will shoot you
like a rabbit!"</p>

<p>"Sir William," cried Peter, "I appeal to you!
You are the representative of Law and Order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
here. He is threatening a breach of the Peace&mdash;the
<i>Queen's</i> Peace! I call upon you to interfere!"</p>

<p>"I am no advocate," said Sir William, with
judicial calm, "for taking the law into one's own
hands. I even express a hope that this gentleman
will not carry out his avowed intention, at least
until I have had time to withdraw, and I must not
be understood to approve his action in any way.
At the same time, I am distinctly of opinion that
he has received sufficient provocation to excuse
even such extreme measures, and that the fate he
threatens will, if summary, at least be richly
deserved."</p>

<p>"I think so too," said Sophia, "though it
would be painful to be compelled to witness it!"</p>

<p>"Terrible!" agreed Miss Tyrrell. "Let us hide
our eyes, dear!"</p>

<p>"Stay, Alfred!" Miss Davenport implored,
"have some pity! Think&mdash;with all your faults,
you are a keen sportsman&mdash;you would not shoot
even a rabbit sitting! Give Mr. Tourmalin a
start of a few seconds&mdash;let him have a run before
you fire!"</p>

<p>All this time Alfred was still fumbling for and
execrating the obstinate weapon.</p>

<p>"I decline to run!" Peter cried from his seat;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
he knew too well that he could not stir a limb.
"Shoot me sitting, or not at all, but don't keep me
waiting any longer!"</p>

<p>His prayer seemed likely to be granted, for
Alfred had at last succeeded in extricating the
revolver; but before he could take aim, the Bank
Manager and the Melbourne man ran in and
interposed.</p>

<p>"Hold on one minute, sir," they said; "we, too,
have business with the gentleman on the seat
there, and you will admit that it must be concluded
before yours, if it is to be settled at all. We
must really ask you to postpone your little affair
until we have finished. We will not keep you
waiting any longer than we can help."</p>

<p>The Judge, with an ostentatious indifference,
had strolled away to the smoking-room, probably
to avoid being called upon to decide so nice a
point as this disputed precedence; his daughter,
Miss Davenport, and Sophia had turned their
backs, and, stopping their ears, were begging to be
told when all was over.</p>

<p>Alfred was struggling to free his pistol-arm,
which was firmly held by the other two men, and
all three were talking at once in hot and argumentative
support of their claims. As for Peter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
he sat and looked on, glued to his seat by terror:
if he had any preference among the disputants, he
rather hoped that Alfred would be the person to
gain his point.</p>

<p>All at once he saw Sophia turn round and, with
her fingers still pressed to her ears, make energetic
contortions of her lips, evidently for his benefit.
After one or two repetitions, he made out the
words she was voicelessly framing.</p>

<p>"<i>Run for it!</i>" he interpreted. "<i>Quick ...
while you can!</i>"</p>

<p>With his habitual respect for her advice, he rose
and, finding that the power of motion had suddenly
returned, he <i>did</i> run for it; he slipped quietly
round the corner and down the passage to the
other side of the ship, where he hoped to reach
the saloon-entrance, and eventually regain his
cabin.</p>

<p>Unhappily for him, the grim lady from Melbourne
had noted his flight and anticipated its
object. Long before he got to the open doors, he
saw her step out and bar the way; she had an
open sunshade in her hand, which she was preparing
to use as a butterfly net.</p>

<p>He turned and fled abruptly in the opposite
direction, intending to cross the bridge which led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
aft to the second-class saloon deck, where he might
find cover: but as he saw, on turning the corner,
the Manager had already occupied the passage,
Peter turned again and doubled back across the
ship, making for the forecastle; but he was too
late, for the Melbourne man was there before him,
and cut off all hope of retreat in that quarter.</p>

<p>There was only one thing left now: he must
take to the rigging, and accordingly the next
moment, scarcely knowing how he came there, he
was clambering up the shrouds for dear life!</p>

<p>Higher and higher he climbed, slipping and
stumbling, and catching his unaccustomed feet in
the ratlins at every step; and all the way he had
a dismal conviction that as yet he had not nearly
exhausted the cheque he had drawn. He must
have at least another couple of hours to get
through, not to mention the compound interest,
which the Bank seemed characteristically enough
to be paying first.</p>

<p>Still, if he could only stay quietly up aloft till
his time was up, he might escape the worst yet.
Surely it was a sufficient penalty for his folly to
have embroiled himself with every creature he
knew; to have been chivied about the deck of an
ocean steamer by three violent men, each thirsting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
for his blood; and to be reduced to mount the
rigging like an escaped monkey!</p>

<p>A few more steps and he was safe at last! Just
above was a huge yard, flattened on the upper
surface, with a partially furled sail, behind which
he could crouch unseen; his hands were almost
upon it, when a bronzed and bearded face appeared
above the canvas&mdash;it was one of the English
crew.</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, sir," said the man, civilly
enough, "but I shall 'ave fur to trouble you to go
down agin, please. Capt'in's strick orders, sir.
Passengers ain't allowed to amuse theirselves
climbing the rigging!"</p>

<p>"My good man!" said Peter, between his pants,
"do I <i>look</i> as if I was amusing myself? I am
pursued, I tell you. As an honest, good-hearted
British seaman&mdash;which I am sure you are,&mdash;I
entreat you to give me a hand up, and hide me:
it&mdash;it may be life or death for me!"</p>

<p>The man wavered; the desperate plight Peter
was in seemed to arouse his compassion, as it well
might.</p>

<p>"I <i>could</i> 'ide yer, I suppose, come to that," he
said slowly; "but it's too late to think o' that
now. Look below, sir!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter glanced down between his feet, and saw
two swarthy Lascars climbing the rigging like
cats. Lower still, he had a bird's-eye view of the
deck, about which his enemies were posted in
readiness for his arrival: the Manager exhibiting
his spiked boots to Sir William, who shook his
head in mild deprecation; the old lady brandishing
her sunshade in angry denunciation, while her
brother flourished his horsewhip; and Alfred stood
covering him with his revolver, prepared to pick
him off the instant he came within range!</p>

<p>And Peter hung there by his hands&mdash;for his feet
had slipped out of the ratlins&mdash;as helpless a target
as any innocent bottle in a shooting-gallery, and
the Lascars were getting nearer and nearer!</p>

<p>He could see their bilious eyeballs, and their
teeth gleaming in their dusky faces. He felt a
bony hand reaching for his ankles, and then a
dizziness came over him: his grip upon the
coarse, tarry cordage relaxed, and, shutting his
eyes, he fell&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;down. Would the
fall never come to an end? Would he never
arrive?...</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><b>Dénoûment.</b></p>

<p class="pn p2">At last! The shock was over; and he
feebly opened his eyes once more, to
find that he was undoubtedly on the
deck; and, yes, the Bank Manager was standing
over him with a kind of triumphant grin!</p>

<p>"Mercy!" Peter murmured faintly. "You&mdash;you
surely wouldn't kick a man when he's down!"</p>

<p>"My dear sir!" protested the Manager, "why
should I wish to kick you in <i>any</i> position?"</p>

<p>He must be fatally injured, if even the Manager
had relented!</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is Alfred there?" asked Tourmalin, anxiously.
"Keep him away, if you can!"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" said Mr. Perkins. "Who <i>is</i>
Alfred?"</p>

<p>"Why, the&mdash;the man with the revolver. I
thought you knew!"</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the Manager, "there's no
man of that kind here, I assure you. Pull yourself
together, sir; you're on board the <i>Boomerang</i>
now!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know," said Peter, dolefully,&mdash;"I know I
am!"</p>

<p>He shut his eyes resignedly. He was about to
receive some other portion of his time-balance. If
he could only hope that no fresh complications
would arise! Would he meet Miss Tyrrell or
Miss Davenport next, he wondered, and how
would they behave?</p>

<p>"Haven't you had sleep enough yet?" said the
Manager. "You're not more than half-awake
even now!"</p>

<p>"Sleep?" exclaimed Tourmalin, sitting up and
rubbing his eyes. "Why, you don't mean to tell me
I've been dreaming all this time!"</p>

<p>"I don't know about dreaming; but I can
answer for your snoring. Why, you almost
drowned the ship's band! I knew what would
happen when you <i>would</i> have two helpings of curry
at breakfast. Worst thing to take in the world,
especially if you don't walk it off! Why, you've
been the joke of the whole ship for the last half-hour.
I wish you could have seen yourself, with your
head hanging over the arm of your chair and your
mouth wide open! I thought at last it was only
kind to wake you up. Those two young ladies
over there have been in fits of laughter!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter picked up Buckle, which was lying face
downwards on the deck. His own face was very
red, possibly from stooping, as he inquired:</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;<i>which</i> two young ladies?"</p>

<p>"Can't tell you their names; but those two
uncommonly nice-looking girls&mdash;one in white and
navy-blue, and the darker one in pink. Dear me,
I thought they would have died!"</p>

<p>Even now they seemed to have the greatest
difficulty in controlling their countenances, for
happening just then to look round and catch
Peter's glance of confused and still somnolent
suspicion, they buried their faces in their handkerchiefs
once more, in agonies of suppressed
mirth.</p>

<p>And these were the two whom his dreaming
fancies had pictured as tenderly, desperately,
madly devoted to him! The reality was decidedly
disenchanting: they were very ordinary girls, he
saw, after all.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Perkins, "it's not far off
tiffin time now; so, you see, you managed to get
through your extra time after all!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peter, with a little natural embarrassment;
"but I think, do you know,
that, on reflection, I&mdash;I <i>won't</i> deposit the extra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
hours after all! If you will kindly take back
the&mdash;the cheque-book," he added, feeling in
his pockets, "and give me the form I signed,
we will consider the arrangement cancelled&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"It's my belief," said the Manager, "that your
head isn't quite clear yet; for, hang me if I know
what you 're talking about! Deposit? cheque-book?
form? What is it all about?"</p>

<p>Peter coloured more furiously than before.</p>

<p>"It was the curry," he said. "I wasn't quite
sure whether&mdash;but it's really too absurd to explain.
I am wide-awake now, at all events!"</p>

<p>He was awake now, and knew that no time-bargain
of this monstrous kind had ever been
actually effected, and all the wild events which
seemed to have taken whole months to accomplish
themselves, were the work of a single hour's
indigestion! He was still a bachelor; still
engaged to Sophia: he had still to make the
acquaintance of Miss Tyrrell and Miss Davenport,
and endure the ordeal of remaining for
some weeks to come&mdash;to say nothing of the
extra hours&mdash;exposed to the peril of their fascinations!</p>

<p>But whatever happened now, it could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
said, at least, that he had not received abundant
warning of the consequences which might ensue
from any yielding, however blameless or defensible,
on his part.</p>

<p>And Peter Tourmalin resolved that henceforth
Buckle should monopolise his attention.</p>

<h2 class="p4 b1">THE EPILOGUE.</h2>

<hr class="dec1" />

<p class="pn p2">There are always a few inquiring persons
who, at the conclusion of any story, insist
upon being told "what happened after
that." And if such a question is ever justified,
it is so in the case of a narrative that, as in
the present instance, ends almost at the precise
moment at which it began.</p>

<p>So it is not impossible that some readers may
be sufficiently interested to wish to know the particular
effect produced upon Peter Tourmalin's
subsequent conduct by a vision more than usually
complicated and connected.</p>

<p>Did he receive it, for example, as a solemnly
prophetic warning, and forswear all female
society while on board the <i>Boomerang?</i> or was he
rather prompted to prove its fallibility by actual
experience?</p>

<p>As to the motives which guided him, we are
unable to speak with confidence, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
must be left to be accounted for by the reader's
knowledge of human nature in general, and
Peter's, so far as it has been self-revealed by
his unconscious imagination in these pages, in
particular.</p>

<p>But the author is in a position to state with certainty
that, when Sophia and her mother met the
ship, as they duly did at Gibraltar, nothing on
Peter's part gave them the slightest ground for suspecting
that he was on terms of even the most
distant acquaintanceship with either Miss Tyrrell
or Miss Davenport, and that the fact of his being
far advanced in the third volume of Buckle's <i>History
of Civilisation</i> seemed to guarantee that he had
employed his spare time on board the vessel both
wisely and well.</p>

<p>Nor did he get into any difficulties by circulating
gossip concerning any matron from
Melbourne, owing to the circumstance that
there was no lady passenger who at all answered
the description. She, like much else in
his experiences, was purely a creation of the
curry.</p>

<p>Lastly, it may be added that Peter is now married
to his Sophia, and is far happier than even he
could have expected. She tempers her intellectuality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
out of consideration for his mental bareness;
and as yet he has never found her society in the
least oppressive, nor has his errant fancy wandered
back in any perfidious sense to the time he spent,
when freed from her supervision, on board the
<i>Boomerang</i>.</p>
